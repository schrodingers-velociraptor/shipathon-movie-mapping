[A smoky cube shaped object emerges, The Tesseract filling the screen with darkness. We see a throne room in space, we see a clothed figure, the other]

The Other: The Tesseract has awakened It is on a little world, a little human world, they would wield it's power

[The Other faces an armored figure with a horned helmet, he is Loki of Asgard, Loki is handed a scepter, the Chitauri scepter long, golden with a blue gem]

The Other: But our ally knows it's workings as they never will, he is ready to lead. And our force the Chitauri will follow

[Ten of Thousands of CHITAURI stand ready in a seething mass of neat rows and columns, the ground simply QUAKES.]

The Other: (V.O.)The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?

[PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY ​- NIGHT Out in the NEW MEXICO desert]

[a remote research facility is in a state of panic. It's an evacuation. A swooping helicopter flies in. it is chaos Men in suits run around, getting everything they need Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating the hell out of there. A voice speak from the hidden loudspeakers.

Helicopter landing pad, Standing he's a few yards from the landing pad, Agent Phil Coulson in a suit with badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. Walking out of the helicopter is Agent Maria Hill the deputy director of SHIELD following her is Nick Fury director of SHIELD, the two approach Coulson]

Nick Fury: How bad is it?

Phil Coulson: That's the problem sir we don't know

[Cut to inside the facility Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run around, taking only the essentials.]

Phil Coulson: Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.

Nick Fury: NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test phase.

Phil Coulson: He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous event.

Maria Hill: (Disbelief) It just turned itself on?

Nick Fury: What are the energy levels now?

Phil Coulson: Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered the evac.

Nick Fury: How long to get everyone out?

Phil Coulson: Campus should be clear in the next half hour.

Nick Fury: Do Better

[Coulson nods and walks away

Hill and Fury continue walking]

Maria Hill: Sir, evacuation may be futile.

Nick Fury: (sarcasm) We should tell them to go back to sleep?

Maria Hill: If we can't control the Tesseract's energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance.

Nick Fury: I need you to make sure Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.

Maria Hill: (confused) Sir, is that really a priority right now?

Nick Fury: (Serious) Until such a time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.

Maria Hill: (Deadpanned) Yes sir. (to two agents nearby) With me.

[Nick Fury enters a lab surrounded by scientist who are leaving as quick as they can, leaving only the required people in the lab]

Nick Fury: Talk to me doctor

[Erik Selvig appears from behind a machine]

Erik Selvig: Director

[Erik walks over to Fury]

Nick Fury: Is there anything we know for certain?

Erik Selvig: (Serious) The Tesseract is misbehaving.

Nick Fury: (deadpan) Is that supposed to be funny?

Erik Selvig: No, it's not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she's... misbehaving.

Nick Fury: I assume you pulled the plug

[Fury and Erik walk, Selvig goes to a computer]

Erik Selvig: She's an energy source. If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level...

Nick Fury: We've prepared for this doctor. Harnessing energy from space.

Erik Selvig: (looking up from his computer) We don't have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now she's throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.

Nick Fury: (unimpressed) That can be harmful. Where's Barton?

Erik Selvig: (scoffs) The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual

[We cut to Agent Clint Barton, dressed in black tactical gear, up on the railings observing from above. As Fury calls Barton on his earpiece.]

Nick Fury: Agent Barton report

[Clint Barton rappels down from the catwalk, and walks up to Fury. They both walk around the bottom of the facility in a discreet manner.]

Nick Fury: I gave you this mission so you could keep a close eye on things

Clint Barton: Well I see better from a distance

[Fury and Clint continue walking]

Nick Fury: Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?

[They walk to the Tesseract machine]

Nasa Scientist: Doctor, It's spiking again

[Selvig walks over and begins typing]

Clint Barton: No one's come or gone. Slevig's is clean. No contacts, no I.M.s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.

Nick Fury: (confused) At this end?

Clint Barton: Yeah the cube it's a doorway to space right? Well doors open from both sides

[Dr. Erik Selvig types on his keyboard]

Erik Selvig: (quietly) Not yet

[The monitor flashes. Suddenly, the Tesseract thunders and shakes the entire facility. Both Agent Coulson nearby, and Maria Hill topside and both look upwards, feel the tremors. The cube glows brighter and emits a ring of light, and builds like a beam, similar to the Bifrost bridge. The power hits the edge of the platform, and begins to form a vortex, which becomes a portal. Space appears through the portal, and a gust of blue energy knocks people back. The cloud shoots to the ceiling, and the portal on the platform opens up as Loki steps through. The portal vanishes, and Loki grins at everyone, holding his spear. He frowns as he sees them looking at him.]

Nick Fury: Sir please put down the spear.

[Loki responds with firing a blast of blue energy from his spear, while Barton narrowly tackles Fury out of the way, the two barely miss getting hit. Everyone shoots at Loki, but the bullets deflect off of him. Loki immediately takes down everyone shooting at him easily, with knives and energy blasts from his scepter. Barton commando rolls out of the way. Loki pauses, grinning, and looks to who will attack him next. Barton attempts to attack him, but Loki grabs his wrist, disarming him.]

Loki: You have heart.

[Loki places the tip of the spear against Barton's chest. Barton's eyes glow black, and he stops resisting. Loki begins controlling other agents around the room. Fury sneak up, grabs the Tesseract, and places it in a briefcase, trying to sneak out.]

Loki: Please don't. I still need that.

Nick Fury: (turning to face Loki) This doesn't have to get any messier.

Loki: Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.

Erik Selvig: (looking up from checking on the scientist Loki killed) Loki? Brother of Thor?

Nick Fury: We have no quarrel with your people.

Loki: An ant had no quarrel with a boot.

Nick Fury: You planning to step on us?

Loki: I come with glad tidings, of a world made free.

Nick Fury: Free from what?

Loki: Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart...

[Loki turns to face Selvig who's standing behind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart. Selvig's eyes glow black.]

Loki: You will know peace

[Loki turns to face Fury]

Nick Fury: Yeah you say peace I kind of think you mean the other thing

[The Tesseract cloud is building and getting worse, Barton looks up and walks over to Loki]

Clint Barton: Sir, director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. (looks at Fury) He means to bury us.

Nick Fury: Like the Pharaoh's of Old

[Erik Selvig is typing on a computer]

Erik Selvig: He's right The portal is collapsing in on itself. We've got about 2 minutes before this goes critical

[Loki looks at Clint]

Loki: Well then

[Clint without hesitation shoots Fury and grabs the Tesseract case and walks out with other controlled SHIELD personal]

Clint Barton: (pointing to the ute's) I need these vehicles

[Maria Hill looks around her radio crackling she see Barton and Loki and the other personal]

Maria Hill: (confused) Who's that?

Clint Barton: (not turning) He didn't tell me

[Rock's crumble around them

Maria turns to walk away]

Nick Fury: (on Hill's radio) Hill

[Loki turns and looks at her]

Nick Fury: Do you copy?

[Nick pulls the bullet out, her radio crackles and she looks at it]

Nick Fury: Barton has turned

[Maria turns around quickly only to see Barton shooting at her, she dives out of the way and Barton shoots at her as he jumps down and gets into the drivers seat and begins to drive away, with Selvig in the passenger seat she shoots at the car's]

Nick Fury: (into radio and walking out of the lab) they got the tesseract shut them down

[Maria Hill throws her radio into one ute and jumps in and chases Barton, we see Loki in the tray watching, he fires a blast and Hill is forced to keep her distance plus killing an agent in the process. In the lab, Fury is racing against the clock as pipes burst around him. The walls are cracking, and the facility is suffering an internal earthquake, agent Coulson is cases, and trips down the stairs while the ground shudders. Others with him drop cases full of information and equipment, the agents go to pick it up]

Phil Coulson: No! Leave it, go!

[They all run in fear of their lives, they jump into a jeep]

Phil Coulson: (into radio) Director Fury. You're clear, sir! You need to go!

[With that acknowledgement Fury runs out and too a helicopter which just makes it as the ground sinks, Maria Hill is still chasing Barton, she shoots through her windscreen and his windscreen he returns to favor when Loki blasts part of the cave causing it to collapse in on itself and Hill Ute to become stuck. The Tesseract's energy cloud now shrinks into a small ball of white light, hovering in the air. In a flash of blue light, the facility is consumed along with its surroundings. Fury watches from below as a rapid build up into an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van jolts from the blast wave on the horizon behind them. The entire facility implodes with terrifying magnitude, and the implosion rocks the ground. Maria Hill is stuck, her jeep behind as the full force of the blast tears down on the tunnel, covering herself by being inside of the jeep, light from the night spilling in close by. Barton's truck drives away, but Fury's helicopter hovers over it, and Fury opens fire with his pistol. Loki, in a fit of rage, fires an energy blast at the helicopter. The helicopter is skimmed my the blast, but catches fire. He jumps out of the flaming helicopter seconds before it hits the ground and shreds itself into debris. Fury stands back up, dazed, and shoots at Loki, but they're too far away.]

Phil Coulson: (over a walkie talkie) Director? Director Fury, do you copy?

Nick Fury: The tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?

Maria Hill: (climbing out of the wreckage of her jeep) A lot of men still under, don't know how many survivors.

[From the ground, Fury surveys the wreckage.]

Nick Fury: Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase.

Maria Hill: [using a walkie talkie] Roger that.

Nick Fury: Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven. As of right now, we are at war.

Phil Coulson: What do we do?

[Nick Fury looks up, a thought on his mind.]

THE AVENGERS

[We end up in Russia. There is a building, a warehouse, next to some unfinished railroad tracks under construction. The building is only occupied by Georgi Luchkov, a Russian general, and two thugs, with a prisoner amongst them, she is Natasha Romanoff, tied to a chair in a black dress. The taller thug slaps the spy, she grunts and tilts her head back removing the hair from her face. She and Luchkov have a conversation in Russian]

General Luchkov: (in Russian) This is not how I wanted the evening to go.

Natasha Romanoff: (In Russian) I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better.

General Luchkov: (In Russian) Who are you working for? Lermentov, yes?

[The taller thug pushes her chair back, tilting it over the edge of a few story drop, and Natasha hides her fear.]

General Luchkov: (In Russian) Does he think we have to go through him to move our cargo?

Natasha Romanoff: (In Russian) I thought General Solohob was in charge of the export business.

General Luchkov: Solohob, a bagman, a front. Your outdated information betrays you. The famous Black Widow, and she turns out to be simply another pretty face.

Natasha Romanoff: (raising an eyebrow) You really think I'm pretty?

[Luchkov walks over to a table filled with tools of torture and interrogation, picking up a pair of pliers. The tall thug next to her forces her jaw open.]

General Luchkov: Tell Lermentov we don't need him to move the tanks. Tell him he is out. Well...

[He shows pliers ready to remove her teeth]

General Luchkov: (in English) You may have to write it down.

[A phone rings, and thug 1 looks to Natasha's phone in confusion. He picks it up.]

Thug 1: Da? [He looks to Luchkov.] (In Russian) It's for her.

[Luchkov sets the pliers down and takes the phone]

General Luchkov: You listen carefully--

Phil Coulson: You're at 1-14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out. Put the woman on the phone, or I will blow up the block before you make it to the lobby.

[He places the phone at Natasha's ear who balances it on her shoulder, she is confused]

Phil Coulson: We need you to come in.

Natasha Romanoff: Are you kidding? I'm working.

Phil Coulson: This takes precedence.

Natasha Romanoff: I'm in the middle of an interrogation. This moron is giving me everything.

[Luchkov looks at the henchmen]

General Luchkov: I don't give everything.

[Natasha gives him a look that says 'you sure about that?']

Natasha Romanoff: Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.

Phil Coulson: Natasha... (scene switches to Phil on the Helicarrier) Barton's been compromised.

[Natasha's face darkens]

Natasha Romanoff: Let me put you on hold.

[She nods to Luchkov who takes the phone, she kicks him where no man wants to be injured he falls to the floor and she headbutts him knocking him out, she stands up still tied to the chair and knees one henchman and hits the other with her chair, she does a roll and stands up and places the chair onto his foot and smacks the back of her head against his nose she knocks him down with the chair, she kicks the other one, and on the helicarrier Phil is casually listening probably thinking about lunch and what he is gonna have, how to get Barton back and who is going to inform the former agent Laura Barton? back with Natasha she jumps off one and breaks the chair on the other with a part of the chair back still attached one of the henchmen tires to restrain her from behind, she bends their arm in an unnatural position, and hits him the peice of chair, she then kicks off of his chest does a springboard and flips back up using the momentum she has gained she runs and does the flying scissor leg takedown move she loves so much, knocking him out, she glares and then turns to Luchkov, she grabs the the chain Luchkov begins to stand and she knocks his head on a metal railing causing him to fall back and she wraps the chain around his ankle letting him dangle, she grabs her shoes and phone and begins to walk away, we see a hole in her tights]

Natasha Romanoff: Where's Barton now?

Phil Coulson: We don't know.

Natasha Romanoff: But he's alive.

Phil Coulson: We think so. (Coulson looks at an old mission with Black Widow and Hawkeye more than likely Budapest) I'll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.

Natasha Romanoff: Coulson, you know that Stark only trusts me about as far as he can throw me.

Phil Coulson: No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

Natasha Romanoff: [pausing and looking back at the fighting she did, Russian.] My god.

[We are now in India where a little girl runs through the crowded streets, she runs to a makeshift hospital and up the stairs a man exclaims in Hindi and a woman most likely a nurse sees her and looks in worry]

Attending woman: (Hindi) Who are you? Get out, there is sickness here

[Banner watches in the background]

Little Girl: You're a doctor (continues in Hindi) My fathers not waking up, he has a fever and he is moaning

[Banner walks over and crouches down and speaks Hindi]

Bruce Banner: (Hindi) Slow down, is he like them?

[Banner points to a child and his father who coughs]

Little Girl: (Holding out money) Please

[Banner and the little girl run to the edge of the city when a government car passes them Banner stops the girl and turns, the two then walk into a shack where Banner sees the girl escape through a window]

Bruce Banner: Should have got paid upfront Banner.

Natasha Romanoff: [Entering the room behind him, making Banner turn around.] You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle.

Bruce Banner: Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

Natasha Romanoff: (sarcasm) Then, what is it? Yoga?

Bruce Banner: You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... (looks out the window and sees nothing) assume the whole place is surrounded?

Natasha Romanoff: (removing her scarf) Just you and me.

Bruce Banner: And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young?

Natasha Romanoff: (uncomfortable, slightly nervous) I did.

Bruce Banner: Who are you?

Natasha Romanoff: Natasha Romanoff.

Bruce Banner: (on guard) Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.

Natasha Romanoff: (making her point clear) No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.

Bruce Banner: (Slightly annoyed) SHIELD. How did they find me?

Natasha Romanoff: (as if pointing out the obvious) We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.

Bruce Banner: Why?

Natasha Romanoff: Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now we need you to come in.

Bruce Banner: What if I say no?

Natasha Romanoff: (tad seductive) I'll persuade you.

Bruce Banner: (slightly sad) And what if the... other guy says no?

Natasha Romanoff: (getting to the point) You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak.

Bruce Banner: [gently pushing a cradle] I don't always get what I want.

Natasha Romanoff: Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.

Bruce Banner: Well, those I actively try to avoid.

Natasha Romanoff: This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.

[She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner takes a closer look.]

Bruce Banner: What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?

Natasha Romanoff: Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be.

Bruce Banner: So Fury isn't after the monster?

Natasha Romanoff: Not that he's told me.

Bruce Banner: And he tells you everything?

Natasha Romanoff: Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

Bruce Banner: He needs me in a cage?

Natasha Romanoff: No one's gonna put you in a...

Bruce Banner: STOP LYING TO ME! [Banner slams his fists onto the table]

[Natasha grabs a gun from under the table in one swift movement, she obviously placed it there before Banner came in, she points it at him her eyes glazed over slightly]

Bruce Banner: I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha...

[Natasha doesn't lower her gun thinking, she finally lowers it and speaks into her earpiece]

Natasha Romanoff: (on her earpiece) Stand down. We're good here.

[Dozens of agents armed to have surrounded the small house, but at her signal they back off a bit.]

Bruce Banner: (smiles back at Natasha) Just you and me?

[Natasha has the decency to look embarrassed at being caught]

[we are now in a SHIELD analytical room, filled with monitors of partially silhouetted people. Fury stands in the middle, frowning. They make up the World Security Council.]

Councilmen 1: Director SHIELD operates under the world security council we should have been informed of all the details

Nick Fury: The Council's interest in our work has always been about results not procedure

Councilmen 2: Agent Clint Barton is intimate with SHIELD procedure I believe and now we learn he is working with the enemy

[Fury frowns looking down wondering who told them most definitely not Natasha or Coulson chances are it was Hill]

Councilmen 2: A man whose talent appears to be...

[Fury cuts councilmen 2 off]

Nick Fury: killing, but he didn't kill me, he didn't go for the headshot he's been brainwashed but I won't write him off we're on Loki's trail, we're scrambling a response team

Councilwomen: (spiteful) the avengers

Councilmen 1: The Avengers initiative was shut down director it was a volatile concept at the best of time which this is not

Nick Fury: (lying) this is just a response team

Councilwomen: (snapping) I suggest you make you're response rapid we all know what's at stake

[the screen turns off]

Nick Fury: (to himself) yes we do



[We are now in a Brooklyn gym at night. Occupied by one man, beating a punching bag in the gym lights, alone in the floor, lost in the fight. Steve Rogers. He beats the bag harder trying to get rid of the memories that invade his mind

we see a WWII flashback

we see a Hydra base, Captain America is running through a forest, dodging mortar shells, gunfire and Tesseract energy blasts.]

Steve Rogers: (Echoey) There's not enough time! I gotta put her in the water!

[In the present, Steve's punches become harder and more violent.

in the flashback, Steve places the compass he has, featuring a picture of Peggy Carter, on the dash as the plane plummets towards the ice.

The present, his punches become violent and aggressive.]

Peggy Carter: [flashback voice] You won't be alone.

[Red Skull picked up the Tesseract, and vanishes.

We are back in the present Steve is breathing the bag with everything he has.]

SHIELD scientist: (flashback) Oh my god!

[Steve is lying on a table, half frozen, and still partially trapped in a slab of ice. Two SHIELD scientists run equipment over him, checking for his vitals.]

SHIELD Scientist: This guy is still alive!

[We are back in the present. Steve punched the bag, easily a hundred pounds, across the room with one swing snapping the metal chain and pummeling it back a dozen feet, sand spilling out from where he cracked the fabric. He stands up, breathing hard, and grabs another bag, resuming a more normal routine. Fury walks in.]

Nick Fury: (not at all worried) Trouble sleeping?

Steve Rogers: (pointing out the obvious) I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill.

Nick Fury: (giving idea) Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.

[Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. He sits down.]

Steve Rogers: I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost.

Nick Fury: We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.

Steve Rogers: You here with a mission, sir?

Nick Fury: (walking towards steve) I am.

Steve Rogers: Trying to get me back in the world?

Nick Fury: Trying to save it.

[Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files on HYDRA'S projects, Steve reads it]

Steve Rogers: Hydra's secret weapon.

Nick Fury: Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs.

Steve Rogers: Who took it from you?

[Steve hands the file back to Fury]

Nick Fury: He's called Loki. (Nick hesitates) He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.

Steve Rogers: At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.

Nick Fury: Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.

[Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Steve starts walking out of the gym.]

Nick Fury: Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?

Steve Rogers: (bluntly) You should have left it in the ocean.

[We now see Tony Stark, in his Iron Man suit, is cutting a pipeline transport with a laser cutter coming from his hand in the ocean. He then places a Stark Energy Core. It lights up. Iron Man flies out of the water and flies towards Stark Tower]

Tony Stark: You're good on this end. The rest is up to you.

Pepper Potts: [on the other line] You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid?

Tony Stark: Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.

Pepper Potts: Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over, and it actually works?

[we see inside the suit, Pepper's face appears on the monitor.]

Tony Stark: I assume. Light her up. [Iron Man flies to the Stark Tower Building, the power is switched on the Stark sign lights up]

Pepper Potts: How does it look?

Tony Stark: (smiling) Like Christmas but with more (tilts his head to the side slightly) me

Pepper Potts: We've go to go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I'm in DC tomorrow. I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.

Tony Stark: Pepper, you're killing me. Remember the moment? Enjoy the moment.

[Tony arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process of taking off his Iron Man suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of gadgets.]

Pepper Potts: Then get in here and I will

JARVIS: Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.

Tony Stark: I'm not in. I'm actually out.

JARVIS: Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

Tony Stark: Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

[Pepper Potts stares up at the monitors of the reactor device. As Tony walks in]

Pepper Potts: Levels are holding steady... I think.

Tony Stark: Of course they are I was directly involved, which leads me to my next question: How does it feel to be a genius?

Pepper Potts: Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?

Tony Stark: What do you mean?

[Tony gestures to the tower and everything in it]

Tony Stark: All this came from you.

Pepper Potts: No. All this came from that.

[Pepper taps the energy in his chest plate.]

Tony Stark: Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit.

Pepper Potts: Twelve percent?

[The two sat down and Pepper began pouring champagne]

Tony Stark: An argument can be made for fifteen.

Pepper Potts: (Annoyed) Twelve percent? For my baby?

Tony Stark: Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.

Pepper Potts: Oooooh.

Tony Stark: My private elevator...

Pepper Potts: (correcting Tony) You mean our elevator?

Tony Stark: Was steaming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?

Pepper Potts: it's not gonna be that subtle.

Tony Stark: I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

Pepper Potts: (Laughs) On the lease

Tony Stark: Call your mom, can you bunk over?

JARVIS: Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten.

Phil Coulson: Stark, we need to talk.

[Tony picks up his phone and looks into it at Coulson and answers.]

Tony Stark: You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

Phil Coulson: This is urgent.

Tony Stark: Then leave it urgently.

[The elevator door opens and Coulson appears.]

Tony Stark: Security breach.

Tony Stark: (Tony turns to Pepper) That's on you.

Phil Coulson: Mr. Stark

Pepper Potts: Phil! Come in.

Tony Stark: Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.

Phil Coulson: I can't stay

Pepper Potts: Come on in, we're celebrating.

Tony Stark: Which is why he can't stay.

Phil Coulson: We need you to look this over. [He holds out a file towards Tony] Soon as possible.

Tony Stark: I don't like being handed things.

Pepper Potts: That's alright, 'cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade.

[She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson, takes the file from him, then takes Tony's glass of champagne while passing the file over to Tony]

Pepper Potts: Thank you.

Tony Stark: Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.

Phil Coulson: This isn't a consultation.

Pepper Potts: Is this about The Avengers? (Phil looked at her) Which I...I know nothing about.

Tony Stark: The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify.

Pepper Potts: I didn't know that either.

Tony Stark: Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others.

Pepper Potts: That I did know.

Phil Coulson: This isn't about personality profiles anymore.

Tony Stark: Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? [Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases.]

Tony Stark: You know, I thought we were having a moment.

Pepper Potts: I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken.

Tony Stark: How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

Pepper Potts: What is all of this?

Tony Stark: This is, uh... [Tony expands his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and Pepper.] This.

[Screens appear of Captain America in action, the Hulk roaring as he attacks the army at Culver University, and Thor fighting the Destroyer in New Mexico. Another is of Loki and the Tesseract to which Tony and Pepper look at in awe]

Pepper Potts: I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

Tony Stark: Tomorrow.

Pepper Potts: You've got homework. You've got a lot of homework.

Tony Stark: Well, what if I didn't?

Pepper Potts: If you didn't?

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Pepper Potts: You mean if you finished? [Tony nods his head] Well, um...then.

[She whispers something in his ear. Tony gasps. Coulson looks away obviously uncomfortable.]

Tony Stark: Square deal. It's the last date.

[Pepper kisses him and walks away.]

Pepper Potts: Work hard.

[Pepper turns to Coulson]

Pepper Potts: Any chance you're driving by La Guardia

Phil Coulson: Yeah I can drop you

Pepper Potts: Fantastic

[The two step into the elevator]

Pepper Potts: I want to hear all about that cellist, is that still a thing?

Phil Coulson: She moved back to Portland

Pepper Potts: What? aw boo

[Tony grabs the Tesseract in holograph form, he looks unnerved]

[We are now inside the Quinjet, Steve is sitting down with a tablet, watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver University]

Pilot: We're about forty minutes out from base, sir.

[Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.]

Steve Rogers: So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?

Phil Coulson: A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.

[The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.]

Steve Rogers: Didn't really go his way, did it?

Phil Coulson: Not so much. When he's not that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking. [Steve looks confused.] He's like a smart person. I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially. [Steve smiles at Coulson.] I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. [Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to the side with Coulson following.] I mean, I was... I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, it's really, it's just a... just a huge honor to have you on board.

Steve Rogers: Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

Phil Coulson: Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.

Steve Rogers: The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned?

Phil Coulson: With everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned.

[Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.]

[we are now in the underground lab, Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down, watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of the Other, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. The other appears from the steps.]

The Other: The Chitauri grow restless

Loki: Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle.

The Other: Battle? Against the meager might of Earth?

Loki: Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim.

The Other: You question us? You question him? He who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated?

Loki: I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard! Betrayed!

The Other: No doubt you'll be defeated on Earth,

Loki: They are a lost people, they mistake selfishness for spirit, when the sky falls it'll be every man for himself

The Other: How will you rule them then?

Loki: Unmercifully

The Other: Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.

Loki: You don't have the Tesseract yet. [The Other runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter.] I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words.

The Other: You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain.

[The Other places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back to Earth. Loki looks around, cautiously almost afraid.]

[The Quinjet now lands down a massive battleship known as the Helicarrier. It has two runways. One with direct access to a hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel. Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with Natasha.]

Phil Coulson: Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

Steve Rogers: Ma'am

Natasha Romanoff: Hi. [She looks at Coulson] They need you on the bridge. They're starting the face-trace.

Phil Coulson: See you there.

[Phil walks away, leaving Steve with Natasha, the pair walking towards the railing of the Helicarrier]

Natasha Romanoff: It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?

Steve Rogers: Trading cards?

Natasha Romanoff: (Hiding the fact she is calling Steve vintage) They're vintage, he's very proud.

[Bruce Banner is seen walking around the ship, trying to stay out of the way while people walk in his way]

Steve Rogers: Dr. Banner.

[The two walk up to each other and shake hands]

Bruce Banner: Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming.

Steve Rogers: Word is you can find the cube.

Bruce Banner: Is that the only word on me?

Steve Rogers: (smiling slightly) Only word I care about.

Bruce Banner: [Takes in the sentiment] It must be strange for you, all of this.

Steve Rogers: Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

[Steve looks off to where a group of men in training are running, remembering his days in the army]

Natasha Romanoff: (interrupting) Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breathe.

[The Helicarrier starts to shake as it prepares to take "sail". Agent aboard being to strap down planes and Quinjets in preparation and put on oxygen masks]

Steve Rogers: Is this a submarine?

Bruce Banner: (incredulous with a hint of sarcasm) Really? They wanted me in a submerged, pressurized metal container?

[The two both move closer to the edge of the Helicarrier. Four huge lift fans mounted on the sides starts to lift into the air as the ship takes flight. Steve watches in awe while Bruce just smiles.]

Bruce Banner: (shaking his head) Oh, no. This is much worse.

[The doors part and we enter the bridge of the ship. A flurry of activity, dozens of agents sit in front of their viewscreens. Agent Hill shouts instructions to leave. The camera turns to Nick Fury who is at the command chair.]

Maria Hill: We're at lock, sir.

Nick Fury: Good. Let's vanish.

[The Helicarrier rises high into the heavens. Suddenly the entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then camouflages in the sky. Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge, Natasha looks back at them with a slight smile]

Nick Fury: Gentlemen.

[Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again, Steve begins to walk around marveling in what her was seeing as Hill watches him with slight suspicion. Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.]

Nick Fury: Doctor, thank you for coming.

Bruce Banner: Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying?

Nick Fury: Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.

Bruce Banner: Oh yeah where are you with that?

[Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha crouches down to look at an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen, she swipes to the left and stats appear.]

Phil Coulson: We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.

[Natasha turns her head to the group still crouching]

Natasha Romanoff: (worry) That's still not gonna find them in time.

Bruce Banner: You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?

Nick Fury: How many do you need?

Bruce Banner: Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?

Nick Fury: Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please.

[Natasha stands and nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.]

Natasha Romanoff: You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.

Bruce Banner: Really do you have a commodore 64?

Natasha Romanoff: I'm not sure.

[Banner cuts her off]

Bruce Banner: Oh you're very young aren't you?

[Fury walks over to where Hill is working]

Nick Fury: Agent Hill.

[Maria turns]

Nick Fury: Did you tell the council Barton's been compromised?

Maria Hill: Was that not procedure?

[Fury looks at her and walks to the window

Maria went back to work but kept talking]

Maria Hill: Did you tell them who exactly is on your response team?

[Fury looked back and then kept walking to the window]

Nick Fury: Doesn't appear that I have to.

[Maria looks up frowning as Fury stops at the window]

[we are back in the underground lab, Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device. Clint walks in, holding an iPad, someone shows something to Selvig..]

Erik Selvig: (to person) Put it over there! [To Clint] Where did you find all these people?

Clint Barton: SHIELD has no shortage of enemies doctor (He holds up a screen showing information on Iridium). Is this the stuff you need?

Erik Selvig: Yeah, iridium. It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's very hard to get hold of.

Clint Barton: Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.

Erik Selvig: Well, I didn't know! [Sees Loki coming] this is wonderful the the tesseract has shown me so much it's more than knowledge it's truth.

Loki: I know it uh touches everyone differently

[Clint was in the background talking to a Loki agent]

Loki: What did it show you, Agent Barton?

Clint Barton: My next target

Erik Selvig: (laughs) Stick in the mud he's got no soul, (Clint turns to the doctor) no wonder you chose this tomb to work in

Clint Barton: Well the Radisson doesn't have three levels of lead line flooring between SHIELD and that cube

[Selvig nods absentmindedly and walks away]

Loki: I see why Fury chose you guard it

[Barton and Loki walk through the underground lab]

Clint Barton: You're gonna have to contend with him as long as he's in the air I can't pin him down, he'll be putting together a team

Loki: Will they be a threat?

Clint Barton: To each other more than likely but if Fury can get them on track and he might they could throw some noise our way

[Loki looks at Clint]

Loki: You admire Fury

[Clint and Loki keep walking]

Clint Barton: He's got a clear line of sight

Loki: Is that why you failed to kill him?

[Clint stops walking as Loki walked into the tunnel]

Clint Barton: It might be I was disoriented and I'm not at my best with a gun

[Loki turns with an idea]

Loki: I want to know everything you can tell me about this team of his I would test their mettle I weary of scuttling in shadows I mean to rule this world not burrow in it

Clint Barton: It's a risk

[Loki smiles devilishly]

Loki: Oh yes

Clint Barton: If you're set on making yourself known I could be useful

[Loki walks to Clint]

Loki: Tell me what you need

[Clint opens the case his bow is in and extends the bow]

Clint Barton: I'll need a distraction and an eyeball

[It is now night and we are back on the Helicarrier bridge. As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial recognition, Coulson is standing with Steve.]

Phil Coulson: I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

Steve Rogers: No, no. It's fine.

Phil Coulson: It's a vintage set. It took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but...

Jasper Sitwell: We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent match. wait, cross match, seventy-nine percent.

Phil Coulson: Location?

Jasper Sitwell: Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse. He's not exactly hiding.

Nick Fury: Captain, you're up.

[Steve looks up and nods. Leaves.

We are outside the Stuttgart Museum, night. Loki is standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st Century attire with his scepter disguised as a cane. He walks up to the entrance of the gala. Inside the Stuttgart Museum. A lavished gala with an orchestra playing is interrupted as the head doctor walks up to the mic.

we are back inside the Helicarrier where Steve's locker is. Steve walks into the locker room. As he approaches to the steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated Captain America uniform, along with the famous shield. He stands in silence.

We are back outside the museum. German guards stand in their positions. One of them is standing on tip of the roof, scoping. He then hears a sound. He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an arrow. He raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton and his crew arrive at the doors of the locked science building. Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye scanner instrument. Meanwhile Inside the gala, Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the head doctor is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he flips his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out his gun, but Loki clubs his head in. Chaos erupts. Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures an unnamable creature. Loki pulls out an optical torture device. He plunges down the doctor's eye. The doctor twists in pain everyone screams and runs as Loki smiles. Outside the museum. Suddenly from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen. The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium. Loki slowly walks out and materializes in his gold armor and helmet. The police arrive and with no hesitation, he blasts the cars, flipping them over.]

Loki: Kneel before me.

[The crowd ignores him. And they try to run so three more Loki's appear, surrounding and blocking the crowd from escaping.]

Loki: I said KNEEL!

[While the crowd quietly kneels, Loki embraces out his arms with a wide smile]

Loki: Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.

[As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an elder German man refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.]

Elder German Man: Not to men like you.

Loki: There are no men like me.

Elder German Man: There are always men like you.

Loki: Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. [As Loki is about to execute the man with his scepter as the light glows blue. Right as the energy beam shoots out, Captain America arrives, diving in just in time to block the blast with his shield, and knocking down Loki]

Steve Rogers: You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.

Loki: [Standing up] The soldier. A man out of time.

Steve Rogers: I'm not the one who's out of time.

[From above Steve Rogers, the Quinjet arrives. A machine gun is pointed towards Loki, while Natasha speaks from inside the aircraft]

Natasha Romanoff: (over PA) Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

[Loki sends a blast of blue at the Quinjet. Natasha maneuvers it just in time, giving Steve the time to throw his shield at Loki. They both began to duel it out. Loki flings Steve to the ground, and then Steve throws his shield, but Loki swats it away. As Steve is knocked down by Loki, the scepter is pointed to Steve's helmet]

Loki: Kneel.

Steve Rogers: Not today!

[Steve flips and knocks him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and flips him over]

Natasha Romanoff: This guy's all over the place.

[Suddenly AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives to the Quinjets speakers]

Tony Stark: Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?

[Natasha smirks a little bit. Steve and Loki look up at the sky confused. Tony flies over in his Iron Man suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. Iron Man touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has.]

Tony Stark: Make your move, Reindeer Games.

[Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor disappears]

Tony Stark: Good move.

Steve Rogers: Mr. Stark.

Tony Stark: Captain.

INT. QUINJET - NIGHT

[Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury speaks over her headset.]

Nick Fury (V.O.): Said anything?

Natasha Romanoff: Not a word.

Nick Fury (V.O.): Just get him here. We're low on time.

[With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering.]

Steve Rogers: I don't like it.

Tony Stark: What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

Steve Rogers: I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.

Tony Stark: Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?

Steve Rogers: What?

Tony Stark: It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, during your time as a Capsicle.

[Steve looks at Tony, obviously meeting his ego match.]

Steve Rogers: Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.

Tony Stark: Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.

[THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake violently. Natasha's head snapped towards where she heard it almost afraid]

Natasha Romanoff: Where's this coming from?

[Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.]

Steve Rogers: What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?

Loki: I'm not overly fond of what follows.

[Suddenly, OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet. Not a light. A King. THE MIGHTY THOR. Tony puts the Iron Man helmet back on and OPENS the ramp]

Steve Rogers: What are you doing?

[Thor enters the jet, Tony raises his arm to fire but Thor knocks him away, then grabs Loki by the throat and flies away with him]

Tony Stark: (pointing out the obvious and annoyed) Now there's that guy.

Natasha Romanoff: Another Asgardian?

Steve Rogers: Think the guy's a friendly?

Tony Stark: Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. [Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor.]

Steve Rogers: Stark, we need a plan of attack!

Tony Stark: I have a plan. Attack.

[Tony Stark jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Steve grabs a parachute to follow.]

Natasha Romanoff: I'd sit this one out, Cap.

Steve Rogers: I don't see how I can.

Natasha Romanoff: (serious at this point) These guys come from legends, they're basically gods.

Steve Rogers: There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

[Steve jumps out of the jet.]

[In the mountains, Thor throws Loki into the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJÖLNIR. He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is angry to see him alive in this fashion.]

Thor: Where is the Tesseract?

Loki: (LAUGHS) I missed you too.

Thor: Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!

Loki: Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth.

[Thor drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up Loki. His brother. Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is everything to a man or god.]

Thor: I thought you dead.

Loki: Did you mourn?

Thor: We all did. Our father...

Loki: Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? [Thor lets go of Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even bigger wedge between them.]

Thor: We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?

Loki: (TURNS AROUND) I remember a shadow. Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king!

Thor: So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki.

Loki: (LAUGHS) And you're doing a marvelous job with that. The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you idly threat. I mean to rule them. And why should I not?

Thor: You think yourself above them.

Loki: Well, yes.

Thor: Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill.

[Angry, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up to the ledge. Turns around.]

Loki: I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it...

Thor: Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?

Loki: I am a king!

Thor: Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home.

Loki: I don't have it.

[Mjölnir flies back to Thor's grasp.]

Loki: You need the cube to bring me home. But I've sent it off, I know not where.

Thor: You listen well, brother.

[Thor is knocked off the mountain by Iron Man who tackles him in mid-flight.]

Loki: (mildly amused) I'm listening.

EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

[Thor and Iron Man CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up. IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet opens up.]

Thor: Do not touch me again!

Tony Stark: Then don't take my stuff.

Thor: You have no idea what you're dealing with.

Tony Stark: Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?

Thor: This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice!

Tony Stark: He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of the way... tourist.

[The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree.]

[INSIDE THE SUIT]

Tony Stark: Okay.

[From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree.] Right back at you, bitch! [Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.]

[INSIDE THE SUIT]

JARVIS: Power at 400% capacity.

Tony Stark: How about that?

[Tony fires from his hand repulsor, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and Tony in the Iron Man suit fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.]

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

[The two battle. Tony grasps Thor, elbowing him and SMASHING him into the side of a mountain. Thor jumps off the mountain and takes Tony with him.]

EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

[Thor and Iron Man crash right back down, smashing down every tree possible. Iron Man YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face. Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. Iron Man HEADBUTTS Thor, with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor headbutts Iron Man and sends him across the forest. Iron Man boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up, ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. Iron Man SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift him and SMASH him down hard. Thor summons back Mjölnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put the hammer down, Iron Man uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him, but from behind him, Iron Man CRASHES into his back. Thor stands facing Iron Man. Ready to pounce... Captain America's shield RICOCHETS off a tree between Thor and Iron Man, stopping them. They look up and see Captain America standing on top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.]

Steve Rogers: Hey! That's enough! (comes down; looks at Thor) Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.

Thor: I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes!

Steve Rogers: Then prove it! Put that hammer down.

Tony Stark: Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!

[Thor backhands Tony into a tree, losing all patience raises the hammer.]

Thor: [to Cap] You want me to put the hammer down?

[Thor leaps up raising the hammer, Steve raises his shield above his head, Mjolnir comes crashing into the Vibranium shield causing a shockwave]

Steve Rogers: Are we done here?

[Thor, Steve and Tony stand there in silence, Thor looks around.]

INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY - NIGHT

[DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs, smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks, nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.]

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION - NIGHT

[Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control panel of the cell.]

Nick Fury: In case it's unclear, if you try to escape, if you so much as scratch that glass...

[Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though.]

Nick Fury: Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?!

[Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.]

Nick Fury: Ant.

[Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel trap.]

Nick Fury: Boot.

Loki: (SMIRKING) It's an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me.

Nick Fury: Built for something a lot stronger than you.

Loki: Oh, I've heard.

[Loki looks into the camera.]

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

[The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated. Banner looks at the monitor, intently.]

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION - CONTINUOUS

Loki: The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you?

Nick Fury: How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control. You talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did.

Loki: Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is.

Nick Fury: (SMILING) Well, you let me know if Real Power wants a magazine or something.

[Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back at the camera, smirking.]

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

[Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all just stand there stunned. Finally...]

Bruce Banner: He really grows on you, doesn't he?

Steve Rogers: Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what's his play?

Thor: He has an army called the Chitauri. They're not of Asgard or any world known. He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the Earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

Steve Rogers: An army... from outer space.

Bruce Banner: So he's building another portal. That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

Thor: Selvig?

Bruce Banner: He's an astrophysicist.

Thor: He's a friend.

Natasha Romanoff: Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours.

Steve Rogers: I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He's not leading an army from here.

Bruce Banner: I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.

Thor: Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.

Natasha Romanoff: He killed eighty people in two days.

Thor: He's adopted.

Bruce Banner: I think it's about the mechanics. Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?

Tony Stark: It's a stabilizing agent. (walks in with Coulson; to COULSON) I'm just saying, pick a weekend. I'll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive. (TO CREW) Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.

Tony Stark (CONT'D) (TO THOR): No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing. (referring to the Iridium) Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants. (TO CREW) Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top sails. That man is playing GALAGA! Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did. (covering his eye, looks AROUND) How does Fury do this?

Maria Hill: (sassily) He turns.

[Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.]

Tony Stark: Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.

Maria Hill: When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?

Tony Stark: Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?

Steve Rogers: Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?

Bruce Banner: He's got to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.

Tony Stark: Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.

Bruce Banner: Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.

Tony Stark: Finally, someone who speaks English.

Steve Rogers: Is that what just happened?

[Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as the mutual respect for each other shows.]

Tony Stark: It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. Your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.

Bruce Banner: (LOOKS DOWN) Thanks.

Nick Fury: (WALKING IN) Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you might join him.

Steve Rogers: I'd start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.

Nick Fury: I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.

Thor: Monkeys? I do not understand.

Steve Rogers: I do. I understood that reference.

[Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.]

Tony Stark: Shall we play, doctor?

Bruce Banner: Let's play some.

[As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing.]

INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)

[Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on the scepter for radiation. Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many algorithms and equations.]

Bruce Banner: The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process.

Tony Stark: If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.

Bruce Banner: All I packed was a toothbrush.

Tony Stark: (SMILES) You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.

Bruce Banner: Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.

Tony Stark: Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises.

[Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.]

Bruce Banner: OW!

[Tony looks at Banner closely.]

Steve Rogers: Hey!

Tony Stark: Nothing?

Steve Rogers: Are you nuts?

Tony Stark: (to Steve) Jury's out (to Banner) You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?

Steve Rogers: Is everything a joke to you?

Tony Stark: Funny things are.

Steve Rogers: Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny. No offense, Doctor.

Bruce Banner: No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things.

Tony Stark: You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut.

Steve Rogers: And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.

Tony Stark: You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.

Steve Rogers: You think Fury's hiding something?

Tony Stark: He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. (points to Banner) It's bugging him too, isn't it?

Bruce Banner: (bobbling the words) Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and...

Steve Rogers: Doctor?

[A beat.]

Bruce Banner: 'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.

Steve Rogers: I heard it.

Bruce Banner: (pointing at Tony) Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower it was still all over the news.

Steve Rogers: Stark Tower? That big ugly (Tony gives him a look) ...building in New York?

Bruce Banner: It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year?

Tony Stark: That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.

Bruce Banner: (referring to Tony) So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?

Tony Stark: I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.

Steve Rogers: (taken aback by that) I'm sorry, did you say...?

Tony Stark: JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours I'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. (holds out a bag of blueberries) Blueberry?

Steve Rogers: Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.

Tony Stark: An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome.

Steve Rogers: I think Loki's trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them.

Tony Stark: Following is not really my style.

Steve Rogers: (SMILING) And you're all about style, aren't you?

Tony Stark: (a nerve hit) Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?

Bruce Banner: Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you.

[Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off.]

Steve Rogers: Just find the cube.

[Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility, he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.]

BACK IN THE LAB

Tony Stark: That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.

Bruce Banner: The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us.

Tony Stark: What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit. It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does.

Bruce Banner: And I'll read all about it.

Tony Stark: Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.

Bruce Banner: Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare.

Tony Stark: You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege.

Bruce Banner: But you can control it.

Tony Stark: Because I learned how.

Bruce Banner: It's different.

[Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.]

Tony Stark: Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.

Bruce Banner: So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life? That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

Tony Stark: (A BEAT) I guess we'll find out.

[Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.]

Bruce Banner: You might not like that.

Tony Stark: You just might.

INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C - NIGHT

[Steve, with all his strength, slides the heavy door and quietly walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse, filled with crates stacked. Steve looks up, seeing another level. Checking no-one is around He leaps up high and holds onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.]

INT. VAN - NIGHT

[Inside this van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal prongs and lightly places it in a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, smiling, a devilish smile.]

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

[On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of Jane Foster. Thor looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.]

Phil Coulson: As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster. We've got an excellent observatory in Tromso. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She'll be safe.

Thor: Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig; I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man.

Phil Coulson: He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here.

Thor: They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we... we come here battling like BILGESNIPE.

Phil Coulson: Like what?

Thor: BILGESNIPE? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those?

Phil Coulson: Don't think so.

Thor: They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path.

[Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the window.]

Thor: When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war.

Nick Fury (O.S.): War hasn't started yet. (WALKING IN) You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is?

Thor: I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him.

Nick Fury: A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.

Thor: What are you asking me to do?

Nick Fury: I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?

Thor: Loki is a prisoner.

Nick Fury: Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?

[Thor doesn't answer.]

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION - NIGHT

[Loki paces in the glass cage when he stops sensing someone behind him]

Loki: Hmm. There's not many people that can sneak up on me.

[Loki turns and sees Natasha Romanoff standing there with her arms by her side.]

Natasha Romanoff: But you figured I'd come.

Loki: After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate.

Natasha Romanoff: I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.

Loki: I would say I've expanded his mind.

Natasha Romanoff: And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain. What happens to his mind?

[Natasha steps closer to the cage folding her arms]

Loki: Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

Natasha Romanoff: Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

Loki: (SITTING DOWN) Tell me.

Natasha Romanoff: (she pulls up a chair as WELL) Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh...well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skillset. I didn't care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call.

Loki: And what will you do if I vow to spare him?

Natasha Romanoff: Not let you out.

Loki: (LAUGHS) Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?

Natasha Romanoff: Regimes fall every day. I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian... or I was.

Loki: And what are you now?

Natasha Romanoff: It's really not that complicated. I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.

Loki: Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? Dreykov's daughter?

[Natasha's face changes slightly, her eyes glaze over and she swallows thickly as her mouth opens slightly]

Loki: Sao Paulo, the hospital fire? Barton told me everything. (Loki stands) Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer. Pathetic!

[INTERCUTS - Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.]

Loki (V.O.): You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers.

[The screen comes up with Virus detected from Stark's hacking Fury oversees as Hill goes to see what is happening on one Agent's viewscreen]

Loki (V.O.): You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you. And they will never go away.

[Steve opens a crate. Angry, he looks behind him and looks back into the crate. The crate is filled with HYDRA weapons]

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION - NIGHT

[Loki slams on his cell causing Natasha to flinch slightly]

Loki: I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you. Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear. And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work and when he screams, I'll split his skull. This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

[Natasha turns away from Loki afraid]

Natasha Romanoff: (Distraught) You're a monster. (sniffles)

Loki: (Laughs) No. You brought the monster.

Natasha Romanoff: (turns back around; tears not there) So, Banner... that's your play.

Loki: (Shocked) What?

Natasha Romanoff: (into earpiece to Fury) Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send Thor as well. (Natasha turns back to Loki and taunts him) Thank you for your cooperation.

[Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.]

INT. BANNER'S LAB - MORNING

[Fury walks in the lab, shocked to see Banner and Stark not working]

Nick Fury: (ANGRY) What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

Tony Stark: Uh... kind of been wondering the same thing about you.

Nick Fury: You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.

Bruce Banner: We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.

Tony Stark: And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2?

[Steve walks in slamming a HYDRA weapon on the table causing Fury, Banner and Stark to turn around, Steve is pissed off.]

Steve Rogers: PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons. (TO TONY) Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.

Nick Fury: (trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're making...

Tony Stark: I'm sorry, Nick.

[Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of Phase 2]

Tony Stark: What were you lying?

Steve Rogers: I was wrong, director. The world hasn't changed a bit.

[At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, angry]

Bruce Banner: Did you know about this?

Natasha Romanoff: You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?

Bruce Banner: I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.

Natasha Romanoff: Loki's manipulating you.

Bruce Banner: And you've been doing what exactly?

Natasha Romanoff: You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.

Bruce Banner: Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.

Nick Fury: Because of him. (pointing at Thor)

Thor: (STUNNED) Me?

Nick Fury: Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

Thor: My people want nothing but peace with your planet.

Nick Fury: But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled.

Steve Rogers: Like you controlled the cube?

Thor: Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.

Steve Rogers: A higher form?

Nick Fury: You forced our hand. We had to come up with something.

Tony Stark: Nuclear deterrent. Cause that always calms everything right down.

Nick Fury: Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.

Steve Rogers: I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep...

Tony Stark: Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is this now about me?

Steve Rogers: I'm sorry, isn't everything?

Thor: I thought humans were more evolved than this.

[Fury turned to Thor as Natasha jumped in]

Nick Fury: Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up?

Thor: You treat your champions with such mistrust?

Natasha Romanoff: Are you boys really that naïve? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threats.

Bruce Banner: Captain America is on the threat watch?

Natasha Romanoff: We all are.

Tony Stark: (to Steve) You're on that list? Are you above or below angry bees?

Steve Rogers: Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack...

Tony Stark: Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

[As they argue, they don't realize the blue gem in Loki's scepter is glowing brightly.]

INT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER - DAY

[Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the ship.]

SHIELD base voice: 661 Bravo, please relay your pass code. What is your hull, over?

Pilot: Arms to ammunition, over.

[Inside, Clint and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Clint pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.]

INT. BANNER'S LAB - MORNING

[Back in the lab, the egos of these people keep rubbing off each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.]

Thor: You speak of control, yet you court chaos.

Bruce Banner: It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what are we? A team? No, no, no, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're...we're a time bomb.

Nick Fury: (OFFENDED) YOU need to step away.

Tony Stark: Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam? (puts hand on Steve's shoulder)

Steve Rogers: (swats Tony's hand away from his shoulder) You know damn well why, back off!

Tony Stark: (comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.

Steve Rogers: Yeah. Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?

Tony Stark: Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

[Natasha tilts her head in a way that says 'he's not wrong']

Steve Rogers: I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.

Tony Stark: I think I would just cut the wire.

Steve Rogers: (SMILING) Always a way out... You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.

Tony Stark: A hero? Like you? You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.

OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER

[The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points right at the engine. Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out, but then SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.]

INT. BANNER'S LAB - MORNING

[Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just stands there, unmoving.]

Steve Rogers: Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.

[Thor laughs at them.]

Thor: You people are so petty... and tiny.

[Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.]

Bruce Banner: Yeah, this is a team…

Nick Fury: Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his…

Bruce Banner: Where? You rented my room.

Nick Fury: The cell was just in case…

Bruce Banner: In case you needed to kill me, but you can't. I know. I tried. (A BEAT) I got low. I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out. So I moved on. I focused on helping other people. I was good, until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk.

[Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets unnerved.]

Bruce Banner: You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?

[Black Widow and Fury place their hands on their guns upon natural instinct]

Steve Rogers: Dr. Banner, put down the scepter.

[Banner looks down in shock to see he is holding the scepter]

Tony Stark: Got it.

[Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.]

Bruce Banner: Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my little party trick after all.

Thor: Located the Tesseract?

Tony Stark: I can get there faster.

Steve Rogers: Look, all of us…

Thor: The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it.

[Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.]

Steve Rogers: You're not going alone!

Tony Stark: You gonna stop me?

Steve Rogers: Put on the suit, let's find out.

Tony Stark: I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

Steve Rogers: Put on the suit.

[At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices something about the Tesseract and looks to the group.]

Bruce Banner: Oh, my God!

OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER:

[Clint pulls the trigger on his bow causing the arrow to explode]

INT. BANNER'S LAB - MORNING

[Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner get blasted into the lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony.]

Steve Rogers: Put on the suit!

Tony Stark: Yep!

[Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching his ribs. He puts talks into his earpiece.]

Nick Fury: Hill?!

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE - DAY

[Panic erupts everyone is running everywhere. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the bridge as calm as possible.]

Maria Hill: Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is: down! Can we get a run in? (runs over to an agent, the Galaga player) Talk to me.

Agent 1: (points to monitor) Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but it's impossible to get out there and make repairs while we're in the air.

Maria Hill: We lose one more engine, we won't be. (into earpiece to Fury) Somebody's got to get inside and patch that engine.

INT. BANNER'S LAB - MORNING

Nick Fury: Stark! You copy that?!

Tony Stark (V.O.): I'm on it!

Nick Fury: Coulson! Initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory! Move out!

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE - DAY

[Agent Coulson runs out of the bridge.]

INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER - MORNING

[Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain control, but his eyes are green, his face intense.]

Nick Fury: (into earpiece) Romanoff?

Natasha Romanoff: (into earpiece) I'm okay!

[Natasha looked towards Bruce]

Natasha Romanoff: (quietly, to herself) We're okay, right?

EXT. HELICARRIER DECK - DAY

[Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel down into a corridor.]

Clint Barton: Get that engine down! Detention! Get him through the dark! Come with me.

[Two of his men follow him. They head towards the bridge.]

EXT. ND HALLWAY, CARRIER - MORNING

[Tony and Cap run through a dim, debris filled hall.]

Tony Stark: Find engine three. I'll meet you there.

[Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.]

INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER

[FOCUS ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly. Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner.]

Natasha Romanoff: Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We're gonna be okay. Listen to me.

[Two approaching SHIELD agents arrive to check on her.]

SHIELD agent 1: Are you hurt?

[She waves them away. They see Bruce transforming and run out.]

Natasha Romanoff: We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on my life I will get you out of this, you will walk away, and never…

Bruce Banner: Your life?

[His voice has the change in a growling threat. Another explosion rocks the carrier and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the lights go out.]

Natasha Romanoff: (horrorified) Bruce...

[Banner suddenly starts transforming into the Hulk and gives Natasha one last look. Natasha tries to free herself of the pipe that is on her ankle. She stops. The Hulk , sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a disturbing monster. Natasha manages to get her foot from under the pipe and runs up the stairs with the Hulk chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like she was trained to in the Red Room. She ducks under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of pipes. The Hulk pulls them out from above the catwalk. Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and stealthily escapes. The Hulk lets out a roar of anger but it isn't human.]

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION - DAY

[Loki looks up, smiling knowing Bruce has transformed his plan is working.]

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE - DAY

[Fury RUNS in and sees the chaos has increased even more than before. The helmsmen are in complete disarray.]

Nick Fury: Bring the carrier inwards and head south. Take us to the water.

Helmsman: the navigation is system is still recalibrating after the engine failure.

Nick Fury: (angry) Is the sun coming up?!

Helmsman: (Confused) Yes, sir.

Nick Fury: (Snapping) Then put it on the left! Get us over water! One more turbine goes down and we drop.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE - DAY

[Steve, pushing with all his strength the door to portside, sees SHIELD tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do anything. Engine 3 is totally dead. A large chunk of the port side in blown off.]

Steve Rogers: Stark, I'm here!

Tony Stark: (V.O) Good. See what we got.

[Tony flies in his Iron Man suit and gets close to the damaged engine.

INSIDE THE SUIT

Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and its layouts.]

Tony Stark: I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE - DAY

[Iron Man begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over at Steve.]

Tony Stark: I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position.

[Iron Man flies into giant cooling conductors. Captain America jumps over to the other side of the broken railing. Captain America gets himself to the control panel and opens it up.]

Tony Stark: What's it look like in there?

Steve Rogers: (sighing in annoyance) It seems to run on some form of electricity.

Tony Stark: (smug) Well, you're not wrong.

INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER - DAY

[Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops. Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically. Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk and spins. ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha fires a shot into a liquid nitrogen pipe that hits the Hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of corridors. The sound the monster is coming. Finally, she reaches a long corridor. As she runs, behind her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her. Natasha reaches the end of the corridor, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall, SMASHING INTO THE GROUND. The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.]

INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT - CONTINUOUS

[Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move. The HULK makes his move. SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and wraps around it.]

Thor: We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to think!

[HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM FLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST.]

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE - DAY

[IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine engine. It's bad, but still fixable.]

Steve Rogers (V.O.): The relays are intact. What's our next move?

Tony Stark: Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE - DAY

Steve Rogers: Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded!

Tony Stark: Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag…

Steve Rogers: Speak English!

Tony Stark: See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word.

[Captain America looks over at the other side where he was. He sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.]

INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT - DAY

[Thor smashes into another stack of crates. As he raises his head, he wipes blood off his face, blood from his nose, the growl of the Hulk is not too far. Thor extends his hand out. The Hulk is getting closer. His hand strains toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs right at him. At the last second, MJÖLNIR flies into his hand and Thor smashes the hammer into Hulks chin, Hulk crashes into a jet destroying it. Hulk stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR. Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws Mjölnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but can't. Mjölnir rests atop his hand. Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING. Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.]

Nick Fury: We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.

[Hill nods and walks up and signals some agents. A small device rolls over to their feet.]

Maria Hill: GRENADE!

[The device explodes sending agents flying. In the smoke, Loki’s men enter, guns at the ready. Fury knocks one out, using his gun to shoot at another. While he is taking care of a third, a forth man enters and is about to fire when Hill shoots him in the head. She is pissed and bleeding. Coulson makes his way over to the armory door. Over the intercom...]

INTERCOM VOICE: We’ve got perimeter breach. Hostiles are in SHIELD gear. Call out to every junction.

[Coulson pushes down on a switch and scans his eyeball. Hulk and Thor crash through the floor of the Wishbone lab. Thor lays on the ground, he looks up, and Hulk grabs him by the throat. Fury, Hill, and other agents are shooting toward Loki’s men. The place is chaotic. Bridge Techs are taking cover and hiding from gunfire. Over the intercom]

INTERCOM VOICE: We’ve got the Hulk and Thor on Research Level Four. Levels Two and Three are dark.

Maria Hill: Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

Nick Fury: Get his attention.

Maria Hill: (into earpiece) Escort 6-O, proceed to Wishbone and.

[A fighter jet is slowly pulling up to the helicarrier.]

Maria Hill: (over jet radio) ...engage hostile. Don’t get too close.

Young piolet: copy

[The jet flies to where Hulk and Thor are fighting, seemingly evenly matched.]

Young piolet: Target acquired. Target engaged.

[He fires his guns toward Hulk. The barrage of bullets bounce off of Hulk. He roars, running at the window. Hulk crashes through it, leaping at the jet.]

Young piolet: Target angry. Target angry.

[Hulk lands on the nose of the jet and tears at the metal as it swerves in the air. The pilot tries to eject himself but the Hulk grabs him and throws him off to the side. The pilot’s parachute opens and the plane explodes, sending Hulk plummeting to the earth. Iron Man saws off pieces of debris with a laser. He jumps on them, knocking them off the rotors. A pair of Loki’s men engage, one throws a grenade. Cap jumps into the air and slaps it away. He land back on the carrier and fights them off, standing close to the lever. He ends up throwing one of the men off the carrier. Cap jumps onto a catwalk, picks up a machine gun, and begins firing at the last man. Fury is still shooting at the enemies.]

Nick Fury (to himself): They are not getting through here so what the hell

[Barton fires arrows from above and they explode. He fires another which hits the control panel. Fury sees him and begins to shoot, while the arrow, having hit a plug, hacks the helicarrier systems, causing a second engine to malfunction, it’s dead.]

INTERCOM VOICE: Engine One is now in shutdown.

[The helicarrier tilts dangerously. Everyone in the bridge begins rolling.]

SHIELD WORKER: Sir, we’ve lost all power in Engine One.

[Natasha sits in the carnage of the Hulk’s rampage, shaking. She slowly lifts a hand to her earpiece.]

Nick Fury (over Natasha’s earpiece): It’s Barton, he took out our systems. He’s headed for the detention lab. Does anybody copy?

Natasha Romanoff (into earpiece): This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.

[Natasha staggers to her feet. Ready. Iron Man is trying to push the rotor.]

Nick Fury (over earpiece): Stark, we’re losing altitude.

INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET:

Tony Stark: Yep, noticed.

[Iron Man flies in between the rotors and begins to push, slowly picking up speed as sparks fly. Cap is forced over the edge by a gunman and falls- almost dropping off the carrier, hanging on by a wire. Thor runs into the room where Loki’s contained. He sees the door slide up and runs over to Loki, only to go straight through him. Loki reappears behind him and closes the door, locking Thor inside.]

Loki: Are you ever not going to fall for that?

[Barton is walking along a passage catwalk. Natasha appears behind him and he quickly turns and shoots a bow, which flies by her. She pushes his hand. He charges her and she kicks him, then rolls underneath some pipes, popping up on the other side of the catwalk, kicking him in the knee. He shoots another arrow, which she dodges by dropping across to the next passage. Barton follows her. They fight along that catwalk. The fight's very even. Barton tries hitting her with the bow and she pulls on the string. They fight some more, headbutting and punching. They both pull daggers. Thor his the cage with his hammer, the cage cracks but it begins to shake off the bolts and shudders.]

Loki: (laughs) The humans think us immortal. Shall we test that?

[Loki moves to open the chute beneath the cell, dropping Thor to, what for any regular person, would be certain death. Coulson suddenly appears, wielding a large prototype Phase Two weapon.]

Phil Coulson: Move away please. [Loki steps back from the panel. Coulson gestures to the gun.] Do you like this? We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer. Even I don’t know what it does. Do you wanna find out? [Coulson prepares to fire the weapon when Loki disappears, reappearing behind him and thrusting the point of his spear through Coulson’s chest. He yells and drops to the floor.]

Thor: NO!

[Loki returns to the panel, opening the chute and pressing the button which sends the cell, and Thor, falling from the ship. Natasha and Barton are still fighting. Natasha grabs Barton arm and thrusts it back. He groans as he throws the dagger to his free hand. Natasha grabs that hand too but he hoists her against a wall. Barton grabs Natasha’s hair and pulls, exposing her neck to his dagger. Romanoff sinks her teeth into his arm and he lets go, trying to force her down when she spins, throwing Barton into the railing. He falls to the ground, groaning, then looks up.]

Clint Barton: Natasha? [She sends him a left hook. The cell is still dropping, flipping all over the place. Thor trying desperately to break free from the cell, swinging Mjolnir at the glass sides as he plummets, twisting and turning, through the air. He braces himself against a wall and launches across the space, crashing through the glass and just before the cell slams into the ground. Thor crashes into a field like a meteorite. Coulson is slumped on the floor and Loki turns to leave.]

Phil Coulson: You’re going to lose.

Loki: Am I?

Phil Coulson: It’s in your nature.

Loki: your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky. Where is my disadvantage?

Phil Coulson: You lack conviction.

Loki: I don’t think I-

[Coulson fires the weapon, which shoots a blast of fire similar to that of the Destroyer, sending Loki flying through a wall.]

Phil Coulson: So that’s what it does.

[Fury is working the controls.]

INTERCOM VOICE: All hands to your stations immediately.

[The helicarrier is still falling. Iron Man is attempting to kick start the engine by manually moving the huge rotors. He is pushing the blades, flying faster and faster until they start spinning on their own and the ship levels off. INSIDE THE HELMET:]

Tony Stark: Cap hit the lever!

[Cap still hangs from the side of the ship by a power cord.]

Steve Rogers: i need a minute here!

Tony Stark: Lever! Now!

[Cap hauls himself up. Iron Man is pushed back up against one of the rotors, now spinning too fast for him to escape.]

Tony Stark (CONT’D): Uh-oh.

[Iron Man is sucked into the blades and is spun wildly around before Cap manages to pull the lever and he is able to fly out. He manages to right himself and flies back to the ship, taking out the gunman shooting at Cap. A jet takes off. Inside it is Loki, who is smiling and watching the carrier. Coulson, slumped on the floor with the gun in his lap. Fury enters and kneels down by him.]

Phil Coulson: I’m sorry boss. They got rabbited.

Nick Fury: Just stay awake. Eyes on me.

Phil Coulson: Oh I’m clockin’ out here.

Nick Fury: Not an option.

Phil Coulson: It’s okay, boss. This was never gonna work- if they didn’t have something- to- [His breathing halts and Fury stands to let the medical team through. He leans against the railing. Hill is having a head wound tended to.]

Nick Fury (over Hill’s earpiece): Agent Coulson is down. [Hill pushes the doctor away. Natasha stands on the catwalk as Barton is dragged away by some agents. She listens intently.]

SHIELD worker (over Natasha’s earpiece): A medical team is on its way to your location.

Nick Fury (over Natasha’s earpiece): They’re here.

[Tony and Cap stand together by the engine, quietly listening.]

Nick Fury (over their earpieces): They called it.

[Steve, Tony, and Fury are gathered at a table. Hill stands to the side. Fury pulls a handful of cards out.]

Nick Fury: These were in Phil Coulson’s jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them. [Fury scatters them on the table. Some are wet with blood.] We’re dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Think I had that coming. [Fury begins to make his way around the table to Steve and Tony.] Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number, though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative. [Fury reaches a chair between Tony and Steve] The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes. [Tony stands and walks out.] Well, it’s an old fashioned notion.

[Thor is making his way over to Mjolnir. He hesitates to pick it up, fearing he is not worthy. He clenches his fist. Banner wakes, naked, in a pile of rubble. There is a SECURITY GUARD standing over him.]

Security guard: You fell out of the sky.

Bruce Banner: Did I hurt anyone?

Security guard: There’s nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.

Bruce Banner: Lucky.

Security guard: Or just good aim. You were awake when you fell.

Bruce Banner: You saw?

Security guard: The whole thing, right through the ceiling. Big and green and buck ass nude. Here [He throws Banner a some clothes, which he begins to pull on.] didn’t think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella.

Bruce Banner: Thank you.

Security guard: Are you an alien?

Bruce Banner: What?

Security guard: From outer space, an alien?

Bruce Banner: No.

Security guard: Well then, son, you’ve got a condition. [Banner steps down from the pile of rubble in the warehouse, pulling on the shirt.] So, which one is it?

Bruce Banner: Sorry?

Security guard: Are you a big guy that gets all little, or a little guy that, ah sometimes blows up large?

Bruce Banner: You know- I’m not even sure.

Security guard: You got somewhere to go?

Bruce Banner: Stark Tower. I- no. [The Security Guard looks at him.] Yes.

Security guard: I’d expect some confusion of the mind, since your body’s kind of all over the place, but it has to be one or the other. [The Security Guard gestures Banner to follow him.]

Bruce Banner: I know where I could do the most good, but it’s where I can do the most harm.

Security guard: Well, that’s no different than anybody else. [They walk out the doors.] Me? I’m here is Jersey where I can’t do much of either. And since I’m not likely to move on from this placement, you may as well- pilfer my ride. [The Security Guard gestures to an old motorcycle.]

Bruce Banner: I don’t know which way to go.

Security guard: Your mind’s already made up, son. The rest of you will follow.

[Barton is strapped to a hospital bed. Natasha sits by him as he strains against the bonds, breathing hard and shaking his head.]

Natasha Romanoff: Clint, you’re gonna be alright.

Clint Barton: You know that? Is that what you know? I've got no window. I have to flush him out.

Natasha Romanoff: You gotta level out, it’s gonna take time.

Clint Barton: You don’t understand. Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and stuff something else in? You know what it’s like to be unmade?

Natasha Romanoff: You know that I do.

Clint Barton: Why am I back? How did you get him out?

Natasha Romanoff: Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head.

Clint Barton: Thanks. [Natasha begins to remove the strap restraints.] Natasha, how many agents did I--

Natasha Romanoff: Don’t. Don’t do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for.

Clint Barton: Loki. Did he get away?

Natasha Romanoff: Yeah. I don’t suppose you know where.

Clint Barton: Didn’t need to know. Didn’t ask. He’s gonna make his play soon though. Today. [Natasha walks to the door.]

Natasha Romanoff: We gotta stop him.

Clint Barton: Yeah? Who’s we?

Natasha Romanoff: I don’t know. Whoever is left.

Clint Barton: Well, if I put an arrow through Loki’s eye socket I’d sleep better I suppose.

Natasha Romanoff: Now you sound like you.

Clint Barton: But you don’t. You’re a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you?

Natasha Romanoff: He didn’t, I just

Clint Barton: Natasha.

Natasha Romanoff: I’ve been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.

[Tony stand over looking where the cylindrical glass cage used to be. Steve enters the room.]

Steve Rogers: Was he married?

Tony Stark: No. There was a uh- cellist, I think.

Steve Rogers: I’m sorry. He seemed like a good man.

Tony Stark: He was an idiot. [Tony and Steve slowly move toward each other.]

Steve Rogers: Why? For believing?

Tony Stark: For taking on Loki alone.

Steve Rogers: He was doing his job.

Tony Stark: He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have.

Steve Rogers: Sometimes there isn’t a way out, Tony.

Tony Stark: Right. How did that work for him?

Steve Rogers: Is this the first time you’ve lost a soldier?

Tony Stark: We are not soldiers! I’m not marching to Fury’s file.

Steve Rogers: Neither am I. He’s got the same blood on his hands that Loki does, but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list [Tony looks down at the place Coulson fell, there is a dent in the wall.]

Tony Stark: He made it personal.

Steve Rogers: That’s not the point.

Tony Stark: That is the point. That’s Loki’s point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?

Steve Rogers: To tear us apart.

Tony Stark: Yeah, divide and conquer is great but- he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That’s what he wants. He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience.

Steve Rogers: Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

Tony Stark: Yeah. That’s just previews, this is- this is opening night. And Loki, he’s a full-tail diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered....Son of-a-bitch.

[Selvig is setting up the device to open the portal. Barton is in the restroom and Natasha is sitting on the bed. Steve is suited up, he enters. Natasha stands.]

Steve Rogers: Time to go.

Natasha Romanoff: Go where?

Steve Rogers: I’ll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets? [Barton enters from the restroom, drying his hands.]

Clint Barton: I can. [Cap looks at Natasha, who nods.]

Steve Rogers: Got a suit?

Clint Barton: Yeah.

Steve Rogers: Then suit up.

[In the field, Thor lifts Mjolnir to the skies. Cap straps his shield onto his back. Barton puts on his quiver. Natasha powers up her Widow’s Bite. Her bracelets light up. Tony is in a workshop making repairs to his helmet. Agents walk by in the background. The helmet lights up. Thor summons a bolt of lightning. The field grows dark, with clouds. His armor slowly begins to fly on. Barton and Natasha walk side-by-side behind Captain America, who is leading them through the lower hangar bay. They’re all ready to kick butt. Thor’s armor finally gathers. Cap, Barton, and Natasha walk onto the jet.]

SHIELD engineer: Hey, you guys aren’t authorized to be in here.

Steve Rogers: Son, just don’t!

[Fury is holding Coulson’s cards, over looking the air deck. Hill walks up behind him.]

Maria Hill: Sir.

Nick Fury: Agent Hill.

Maria Hill: Those cards, they were in Coulson’s locker, not in his jacket.

Nick Fury (staring at the cards): They needed the push.

[He sees the quinjet and Iron Man take off towards the city.]

INTERCOM VOICE: We’ve got unauthorized departure from Bay Six.

Nick Fury: They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything.

Maria Hill: Yes, sir.

[Iron Man is flying toward the city, his suit is losing power. He continues to make his way to Stark Tower. Selvig, still under the control of Loki, is ready to activate the device he created with the Tesseract. Iron Man slowly reaches.]

JARVIS: Sir, I turned off the arc reactor. The device is already self-sustaining

Tony Stark: Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

Erik Selvig: It’s too late! She can’t stop now. She wants to show us something! A new universe.

Tony Stark: (annoyed) Okay. [He fires at the barrier around the device, but the Tesseract deflects it, sending the energy outwards, knocking Selvig out and Iron Man back.]

JARVIS: The barrier is pure energy. It’s unbreachable.

IRON MAN: Yeah, I got that. [Iron Man looks down to see Loki on the platform outside the penthouse.] plan B.

JARVIS: Sir, the Mark Seven is not ready for deployment.

Tony Stark: Then skip the spinning rims, we’re on the clock. [Tony lands and as his suit is deconstructed, he walks through into the tower penthouse, watching Loki carefully. Loki walks in as well. Inside the tower, Loki walks forward as Tony goes behind his bar.]

Loki: Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity.

Tony Stark: Uh- actually, I’m planning to threaten you.

Loki: You should have left your armor on for that.

Tony Stark: Yeah, it’s seen a bit of mileage. You’ve got the uh- blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?

LOKI: Stalling me won’t change anything.

TONY: No, no, no- threatening. No drink? You sure? I’m having one.

LOKI: The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear?

TONY: The Avengers. It’s what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. ’Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’ type of thing.

LOKI: Yes, I’m met them.

TONY: Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I’ll give you that one. But, let’s do a head count here. Your brother, the Demi-God; [Loki turns away and Tony slips a pair of bracelets onto his wrists.] A super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you’ve managed to piss off every single one of them.

LOKI: That was the plan. [Tony begins to walk to the center of the penthouse where Loki is.]

TONY: Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they’ll come for you.

LOKI: I have an army.

TONY: We have a Hulk.

LOKI: Oh, I thought the beast had wandered off.

TONY: Yeah- you’re missing the point. There’s no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it’s too much for us, but it’s all on you. ’Cause if we can’t protect the earth, you can be damned well sure we’ll avenge it. [Loki walks over to Tony, pointing his scepter.]

LOKI: How will your friends have time for me, when they’re so busy fighting you? [Loki walks up to Tony, and places the tip of the scepter over his heart. It clinks against the arc reactor.] This usually works.

TONY: Well, performance issues. You know? [Loki grabs Tony by the throat and throws him across the room.] JARVIS, anytime now. [Loki grabs Tony again.]

LOKI: You will all fall before me.

TONY: JARVIS. Deploy. [Loki sends Stark crashing through the window, and plummeting toward the ground.] Deploy! [Behind Loki, the Mark Seven suit goes rocketing past and out after Stark It catches up to him and, locking on to the bracelets, attaches to him and unfolds to a full suit. Tony manages to stop his fall moments before he hits the ground and flies back up to Loki at the window.] And there’s one other person you pissed off! His name is Phil. [Iron Man fires a repulsor blast at Loki and he is knocked down. Meanwhile the device has powered up and shoots a stream of blue energy at the sky, which opens into a portal where the Chitauri army waits. The hoards of aliens begin to fly through] Right! Army. [Iron Man speeds towards the incoming army, shooting at them. The Chitauri fire back at him. He fires more blasts, spinning out the way, dodging the exploding debris. Iron Man continues flying higher. BAM! He is hit by a Chitauri hovercraft. He rights himself and releases mini-missiles at the Chitauri, blowing them up. The citizens get out of their taxis and vehicles, looking to the sky. They run for their lives as the Chitauri come toward them blowing up cars, buildings, and the streets. The Chitauri fire at the restaurant. WAITRESS and her co-workers are left outside, they duck and take cover from the shots. When they get the chance, they take off inside the cafe. her co-workers, and customers look out the window at the destruction that the aliens cause. Loki walks out on the pad, his Asgardian armor materializing as he looks out over the chaos below. Suddenly, Thor lands lower on the platform.]

Thor: Loki, turn off the Tesseract or I’ll destroy it!

Loki: You can’t. There is no stopping it. There is only the war!

Thor: So be it. [Loki leaps at Thor and the two begin to fight, a blast from Loki’s scepter sending one of the letters of STARK falling to the ground. Civilians are running for their lives, screaming. Several police cars show up. POLICE SERGEANT and YOUNG COP step out of their car where they look up at the Chitauri. The Quinjet flies toward Stark Tower, which is beaming the blue stream to the sky.]

Natasha Romanoff (V.O): (over Tony’s helmet) Stark, we’re on a three heading north east.

Tony Stark: What, did you stop for drive-thru? Swing that park, I’m gonna lay ’em out for you. [Iron Man flies fast, leading a troop of Chitauri, past Stark Tower where Thor and Loki are still fight each other. He flies around the building, takes a sharp turn causing some of the troop to crash. Barton and Natasha are piloting the plane. They release the canon gun. Iron Man flies past them at high-speed and they release continuous fire at the troop of Chitauri in front of them. They fly through the smoke and up to Stark Tower.]

JARVIS: Sir, we have more incoming.

Tony Stark: Fine. Let’s keep them occupied. [The Quinjet comes around a building, blasting the army who are firing at them. One of the wings are grazed by Chitauri gunfire. They slow as the come to. Thor smashes Loki’s head into a glass on the catwalk of Stark Tower. They still fight.]

Clint Barton: Nat!

Natasha Romanoff: I see ’em. [Loki spots the jet. He throws Thor to the floor, then blasts one of the jet’s rotor blades with his scepter it catches fire. Thor sees, angry, charges Loki and tackles him as the Quinjet falls to the ground. Loki and Thor throw punches. INSIDE THE QUINJET: Natasha and Barton hold on for their dear lives. Cap grabs a hold of the roof as the plane grazes buildings and crashes to the street. Natasha and Barton remove their headsets, open the ramp, and Cap and them exit the jet.]

Steve Rogers: We gotta get back up there. [They run onto the overpass, looking up at Stark Tower. They freeze as they see a giant armored Leviathan a warship of the Chitauri, flies through the portal with more warriors. They warriors jump onto the side of buildings and into the buildings where they shoot civilians.]

Steve Rogers: Stark, are you seeing this?

Tony Stark: Seeing. still working on believing, Where’s Banner? Has he shown up yet?

Steve Rogers: Banner?

Tony Stark: Just keep me posted. [Iron Man flies after the Leviathan.] JARVIS, find me a soft spot. [The Leviathan tears through buildings, roaring. Thor holds Loki down and gestures to the chaos in Manhattan below them.]

Thor: Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule?

Loki: It’s too late. It’s too late to stop it.

Thor: No. We can, together. [Loki pauses, then slips a knife into his hand and stabs Thor.]

Loki: Sentiment! [Thor gets back up and lifts Loki, then drops him. Loki rolls himself off the edge of the building, only to land on one of the flying Chitauri crafts. He flies off with a troop of Chitauri. Barton and Natasha are crouched behind a taxi cab. Cap runs over.]

Clint Barton: We’ve got civilians trapped. [Loki flies over them on the flying crafts.]

Steve Rogers: Loki. [Loki and his following troop blowing up the streets. A JAPANESE FAMILY runs away as they are almost shot. A flying craft flies through a Dr. Pepper truck. Loki and the troop come to a busy street the one where the YOUNG COP and POLICE SERGEANT are at and blow up cars. The police and civilians run for their lives. BACK TO OVERPASS: They’re fish in a barrel down there. Natasha stands and fires both her guns at an incoming group of Chitauri.]

Natasha Romanoff: We got this. It’s good. Go!

Steve Rogers: You think you can hold them off?

Clint Barton: Captain, it would be my genuine pleasure. [Barton grabs a arrow and shoots it, hitting one alien in the head, the arrow quickly separates into more arrows, killing three Chitauri aliens. Cap leaves the other two fighting and jumps off an overpass, rolling onto a bus and into the street. Barton helps people off a bus as Natasha shoots her pistols at Chitauri. He runs over to Natasha and begins releasing arrows as she shoots.]

Natasha Romanoff: Just like Budapest all over again!

Clint Barton: You and I remember Budapest very differently. [Cap runs through the street towards a group of police shooting at Chitauri. He is running and jumping off cars. YOUNG COP It’s gonna be an hour before they scramble the National Guard.]

Police Sergeant: National Guard! [The two duck to avoid a Chitauri blast.] Does the army know what’s happening here? Do we? [YOUNG COP Cap jumps down on the car in front of them.]

Steve Rogers: (gesturing) You need men in these buildings. There are people inside and they can be running right into the line of fire. You take them to the basement or through the subway, you keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

POLICE SERGEANT: Why the hell should I take orders from you? [Two Chitauri warriors attack Cap, he fights them off easily then turns back to the two men. The two cops stand shock. The POLICE SERGEANT reacts and walks back to his men.] I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets. (into radio) We gonna set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th street. [Iron Man fires a stream of ammunition at the Leviathan, which turns to follow him.]

Tony Stark: well, we got its attention, what the hell was step two [Stark flies off and the Leviathan follows him. Barton and Natasha are fighting warrior up close. Barton trips one with his bow. He pulls an arrow and stabs it. Natasha is using her Widow’s Bite on a warrior as she sits on his neck. Natasha picks up a Chitauri weapon and is using it to fight off the warriors. One warrior tries to slice her head off and she slides, dodging it. She jumps to her feet and hits it in the head with the sharp part of the weapon. Barton knocks over another warrior. He grabs an arrow and shoots behind himself, killing another warrior. He marches over to another Chitauri and battles him. Meanwhile Natasha is taking on three warriors by herself. She shoots one, then spins around and stabs one in the neck. Barton is tackled to the cement by a warrior. He groans and stabs one with a arrow, then throws the warrior to the ground. Out of nowhere, another Chitauri attacks him and kicks him onto the trunk of a cab. Natasha stabs a warrior with the Chitauri weapon. She hits the other over the head. She spins to her knees, aims in one direction, and fires. Another Chitauri charges, she spins the weapon in that direction and fires. She continuously fires as Barton fights more aliens in the background. Barton’s head is slammed into the roof of a car. He is then thrown to the ground by a warrior. He’s tired, but he continues to fight. Natasha takes on two more Chitauri. They back her onto a taxi cab. They hit after her but she moves her head out of the way. She gets her footing, and tries to hit them with the weapon but a warrior grabs it and throws her feet into the air. She lands on the car and screams in pain, breathing heavily. Barton shoots more warriors around them, they are becoming overwhelmed but they keep on. Natasha regains her strength, runs to the aid of Barton by firing at Chitauri as he slides and shoots at Chitauri. Natasha and Barton are becoming surrounded by Chitauri and Cap rejoins them-- hitting Chitauri out the way. Thor drops down from the tower and kills Chitauri with a bolt of lightning.]

Steve Rogers: What’s the story upstairs?

Thor: The power surrounding the cube is impenetrable.

Tony Stark: (over their earpieces) Thor is right, we gotta deal with these guys.

Natasha Romanoff: How do we do this?

Steve Rogers: As a team.

Thor: I have unfinished business with Loki.

Clint Barton: (readying some arrows) Oh yeah! Get in line.

Steve Rogers: Save it. Loki’s gonna keep this fight focused on us and that’s what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he’s gonna need us to [He stops, seeing Banner arrive on a motorbike. Cap and the others walk over and Banner dismounts, surveying the damage.]

Bruce Banner: So, this all seems horrible.

Natasha Romanoff: I’ve seen worse.

Bruce Banner: Sorry.

Natasha Romanoff: No, we could- use a little worse.

Steve Rogers: (into earpiece) Stark, we got him.

Tony Stark: (over Cap’s earpiece) Banner?

Steve Rogers: Just like you said.

Tony Stark: Then tell him to suit up. I’m bringing the party to you. [Iron Man flies around a corner and towards the group, followed closely by the Leviathan.]

Natasha Romanoff: (stuttering) I don’t see how that’s a party. [Iron Man draws the creature low and it skims the road. Banner turns and begins to walk away, towards the Leviathan.]

Steve Rogers: Doctor Banner, now might be a really good time for you to get angry.

Bruce Banner: That’s my secret, Cap. I’m always angry. [Banner transforms into the Hulk and punches the Leviathan, smashing it into the ground.]

Tony Stark: Hold On! [Iron Man blasts a missile at the creature and it explodes. Barton ditches. Thor stands taking the blast. Cap shields Natasha. The Chitauri cry out. 360 spin: The Avengers stand in a circle, Hulk roars, Hawkeye nocks an arrow, Thor readies Mjolnir, Black Widow loads her gun, Captain America stands ready and Iron Man hovers above them, landing next to the Hulk. Loki looks down from above.]

Loki: Send the rest. [The Avengers look up, watching as more Leviathans and hundreds of warriors fly through the portal.]

Natasha Romanoff: Guys?

Tony Stark: Call it, Captain.

Steve Rogers: Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we’re gonna use containment. Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

Clint Barton: (to Tony) Wanna give me a lift?

Tony Stark: Right. Better clench up, Legolas. [Iron Man grabs Barton and flies him up to the top of a building, then flies off.]

Steve Rogers: Thor! You gotta try and bottleneck that portal, slow ’em down. You got the lightning, light the bastards up. [Thor swings Mjolnir, flying off.] (to Natasha) You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And Hulk! [Hulk turns around facing Cap, who points at him.] Smash! [Hulk grins, then leaps off, taking out dozens of warriors that are on the sides of the buildings grabbing them, smashing them, throwing them. Hulk leaps across the air and slaps a flying craft out of the air. Thor lands at to the top of the Chrysler building and summons a bolt of lightning. He sends it shooting out towards the portal, taking out warriors and Leviathan. Fury is at his command center watching the news footage. Hill approaches Fury.]

Maria Hill: Sir. The council is on.

[Barton atop a building, fires relentlessly at Chitauri.]

Clint Barton: Stark. You gotta lot of strays on your tail. [A troop of Chitauri warriors are following Iron Man as he flies above the streets.]

Tony Stark: Just tryin’ to keep them off the streets.

Clint Barton: Well they can’t bank worth a damn. [Barton shoots at crafts. He misses, shooting behind his back without looking but the arrow hits another craft, causing it to explode.]

Tony Stark: I will roger that. [Iron Man flies by Hawkeye who fires at the crafts, blowing them up. Iron Man swerves behind two crafts and fires at them. He continues taking a series of quick turns as the Chitauri quickly drop, crash, or follow.] Oh- boy. [Iron Man goes flying through a tunnel and turns tightly at the end, sending the last few crafts crashing into a building.] Nice call. What else you got?

Clint Barton: (over radio) Well, Thor’s taking out a squadron down on 6th.

Tony Stark: And he didn’t invite me! [Elsewhere, a Leviathan approaches an office building and the inhabitants look on, scared. We hear fast & heavy footsteps. It’s Hulk charging through the building, jumping through the window and pulling the creature away. from the building. Natasha is going to town as she fights a warrior. She is thrown upon of a car. As the warrior is about to attack, Natasha uses her Widow’s Bite on it, shocking him out. She grabs the Chitauri gun and shoots him back. Someone lands behind her so she quickly turns and aims BUT it’s Cap. She stands down and leans against a car.]

Natasha Romanoff: Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don’t close that portal.

Steve Rogers: Our biggest guns couldn’t touch it.

Natasha Romanoff: Well, maybe it’s not about guns.

Steve Rogers: You wanna get up there, you’re gonna need a ride. [Natasha glances up, seeing the Chitauri crafts fly past. She makes her way over to the other side of the overpass.]

Natasha Romanoff: I got a ride. I could use a boost though.

Steve Rogers: You sure about this? [Cap readies his shield in front of him.]

Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, it’s gonna be fun! [Natasha runs at Rogers, who uses his shield to boost her up. She grabs on to a passing Chitauri vehicle. Cap looks up as she flies off in the distance. He looks to his right and there are more warriors coming. Natasha climbs aboard the craft, pulls a dagger and stabs a warrior. She spin kicks him off the craft. She makes her way to the other one and uses him to control the vehicle.] Turn, turn, Ah! [Two crafts come up on Natasha, firing at her. She swerves to avoid them. The crafts are blasted away by Iron Man, who fires away at a fleet behind him. Iron Man takes a turn, coming up on the overpass, where he knocks Chitauri aliens over and lands by Cap, who is fighting and kicking Chitauri. Cap lifts his shield. Iron Man reflects a repulsor blast off the shield, taking out the surrounding warriors. He then flies up the side of a building, hitting more warriors. At the top of which Barton fires into the head of a Chitauri. Two blast are fired at him. He ducks and returns a shot by firing an arrow. The arrow hits the pilot of a craft which falls and gets hit by a Leviathan. On the creature is the Hulk who is fighting off warriors. Thor then lands on the same creature and takes on warriors with Hulk. When Hulk breaks a piece of the creature’s armor off, Thor uses Mjolnir to summon lightning and drive the metal into its head. The creature crashes to the ground, landing in, Thor and Hulk dismount the creature and stand together, breathing heavily. Suddenly, Hulk punches Thor out of shot. Selvig, having been knocked out when Tony tried to stop the Tesseract awakens. He looks around, he’s free from Loki’s control. Army Tanks, and soldiers begin to arrive on scene. They shoot at the Chitauri, a little amazed of what is going on. Cap is on the ground, holding off a Chitauri’s weapon. He pushes the warrior off and onto sharp debris. As he stand]

Clint Barton: (over earpiece) Captain, the bank on 42nd, past Madison. They cornered a lot of civilians in there.

Steve Rogers: I’m on it. [Cap walks off. In the bank, a crown of civilians are surrounded by three armed warriors. Cap jumps through a window and begins to 183 fight. He snaps the neck of one and throws him into the pit.] Everyone clear out! [He is then grabbed by a warrior, who he fights and breaks free. A grenade-like device goes off and it blasts Cap out a window and onto a car after his mask is pulled back from his face. He stands silently while police lead the civilians from the building.]

Councilwoman (V.O): Director Fury. The council has made a decision. [Fury is talking with the World Security Council over his command center.]

Nick Fury: (angry) I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it’s a stupid ass decision, I’ve elected to ignore it.

Councilman: Director, you’re closer than any of our subs, you scramble that jet [Hill is breathing nervously, panicking, as she listens and watches.]

Nick Fury: (O.S) (angry) That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. Until I’m certain my team can’t hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.

Councilman: If we don’t hold them in the air, we lose everything.

Nick Fury: I’d send that bird out, we already have. [Fury hangs up on them. Natasha on board a Chitauri craft. She is shot at from behind and turns to see Loki, on another craft, following behind. She continues on toward the building Barton is at.]

Natasha Romanoff: Oh you! (into radio) Hawkeye! [Barton sees her coming in the distance.]

Clint Barton: Nat, what are you doing?

Natasha Romanoff: Uh, a little help! [Barton nocks an arrow, waiting for Natasha and Loki to come past.]

Clint Barton: I got it. [Barton aims and fires. Loki catches the arrow inches from his face and looks first at it, then at Barton, smirking. The arrow explodes, sending Loki crashing onto the platform at the top of Stark Tower. Natasha jumps off the craft. She flips in the air, landing onto the roof. She rolls, sticking the landing. She flips her hair back. Loki looks up at Romanoff when Hulk leaps up, grabbing him and throwing him through the window of the penthouse. He roars and moves towards Loki, who gets to his feet.]

Loki: ENOUGH! You are, all of you, beneath me! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND I WILL NOT BE BULLIED BY- [Hulk grabs Loki by the feet and smashes him into the floor repeatedly, then throws him aside and walks away.]

Hulk: Puny God. [Loki whimpers in pain. He has been beaten into submission. Natasha walks toward the Tesseract.]

Erik Selvig: (O.S) The scepter. [Natasha turns and walks over to Selvig.]

Natasha Romanoff: Doctor. [She kneels.]

Erik Selvig: Loki’s scepter, the energy- the Tesseract can’t fight. You can’t protect against yourself.

Natasha Romanoff: It’s not your fault. You didn’t know what you were doing.

Erik Selvig: Well, actually I think I did. I built in a safety to cut the power source.

Natasha Romanoff: Loki’s scepter.

Erik Selvig: It may be able to close the portal. And I’m looking right at it. [Selvig looks down to the platform below, where Loki’s scepter lies dropped from when Hulk took him out. Thor is aboard a craft, fighting Chitauri. The craft swerves when a Leviathan crashes through a building, followed closely by Stark, who is shooting at it with lasers]

JARVIS: Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell. [Iron Man pulls away from the Leviathan. He flies fast.]

TONY: JARVIS, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

JARVIS: I wouldn’t consider him a role model. [Iron Man’s knee plates open, pushing out blades. He is heading directly toward the creature’s mouth. He flies through it. Blowing up the creature’s insides and out the tail end. He crashes to the ground but gets to his feet, only to be shot down again by warriors. Barton is attacked by warriors on the rook. He reaches for an arrow, but his quiver is empty. He instead uses the bow to fight them off. Looking up at the sky and seeing hundreds of approaching flying crafts, he pulls a single arrow from the body of a Chitauri and changes its head with the push of a button on his bow. In slo-mo, The Chitauri fire and Barton leaps off the building as it explodes, twisting in mid-air, then firing the arrow. Its head opens up into a grappling hook which attaches to the side of the building. Barton swings from the wire still attached to his bow and crashes through a window into a lower floor of the building. Hulk being attacked by Chitauri warriors. He throws them off and turns his attention to the sky, where dozens of crafts are flying over him, and roars. They all fire at once and Hulk is encompassed in smoke and flame. He roars. A jet is being lifted from the hangar and to the deck.]

COUNCILWOMAN: (over radio) Director Fury is no longer in command. Override seven-alpha-one-one.

JET PILOT: Seven-alpha-one-one confirmed. We’re go for takeoff. [Hill notices something on her command center.]

MARIA HILL: (to Fury) SIR, WE HAVE A BIRD IN MOTION! [Fury runs out of the bridge.] (into earpiece) Anyone on the deck we have a rogue bird. We need to shut it down! Repeat, takeoff is not authorized! [Fury runs onto the deck with a missile launcher and fires, taking the plane out. A second jet takes off and Fury lifts his gun but it is too far. Fury closes the door to the deck.]

FURY: Stark, you hear me? You have a missile headed straight for the city. [Iron Man is down on the ground.]

IRON MAN: How long?

FURY: (over radio) Three minutes. Max. Stay load can wipe out mid-town.

TONY: JARVIS, put everything we got into the thrusters

JARVIS: I just did. [Iron Man blasts away warriors and flies off elsewhere. The jet fires the nuke towards the city and turns around.]

JET PILOT: Package is sent. Detonation in two minutes, thirty seconds. Mark.

[In slow-mo, Cap and Thor catch their respective hammer and shield. Cap and Thor turn and fight off Chitauri warriors. Cap is shot in the ribs and drops to the ground, Thor sends a car rolling towards some of them and them throws Mjolnir in the other way. He helps Captain to his feet.]

Thor You ready for another bout?

Steve Rogers: What, you gettin’ sleepy? [Natasha has retrieved Loki’s scepter and Selvig is setting up his equipment. He points to the device.]

Erik Selvig: Right at the crown! [Natasha begins to push the spear through the barrier surrounding the cube, it’s hard to break.]

Natasha Romanoff: (into earpiece) I can close it. Can anybody copy? I can shut the portal down! [Steve hears and reacts.]

Steve Rogers: Do it!

Tony Stark: (over Cap’s earpiece) No, wait.

Steve Rogers: Stark, these things are still coming!

Tony Stark: I got a nuke coming in, it’s gonna blow in less than a minute. [Stark flies towards the missile, following closely behind it.] And I know just where to put it. [Iron Man grabs hold of it he begins to redirect it toward the city.]

Steve Rogers: (over radio) Stark, you know that’s a one way trip.

Tony Stark: Save the rest for the turn J.

JARVIS: Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

Tony Stark: Might as well. [A plane is slowly flying through the sky. Pepper is watching the news with three others.]

REPORTER: (V.O) Streets in New York City have become a battle ground. The army is here trying to contain the violence but clearly it is outmatch [Her phone starts to vibrate but she ignores it. Fury and most of the other workers are watching the same report.] Billionaire Tony Stark’s Iron Man

[Iron Man is flying with the missile. Tony is thinking hard and hold. As Iron Man flies by, Thor and Cap look to the sky. Iron Man redirects the missile, barely missing Stark Tower, and pushes it up towards the portal. The rest of the Avengers look on. Everyone on the helicarrier cheers in excitement. Fury smiles. Iron Man lets the nuke go as all the lights in his suit go out.]

JARVIS: (cutting off) Sorry, Mis [He watches as the missile hits the Chitauri mother ship and it explodes. The Chitauri warriors collapse, and the Leviathans fall from the sky. Thor and Cap look around as they do. Tony’s eyes close as he falls slowly toward the portal. Natasha stands waiting.]

Natasha Romanoff: Come on, Stark.

Steve Rogers: Close it. [Natasha plunges the scepter into the heart of the device. Just as the portal closes, Tony falls through back to earth. The Avengers look up and see Tony reappear.] Son of a gun! [Iron Man plummets to the ground.]

Thor: He’s not slowing down. [Thor prepares to fly at Stark and catch him when the Hulk grabs him out of the air, slides down the side of a building and crashes to the ground in front of Thor and Cap. Hulk throws Iron Man off him and Thor and Cap run over. Thor pulls off Iron Man’s face plate and Cap listens for a heartbeat, then sees the arc reactor is not glowing. Suddenly the Hulk roars and beats his chest. Tony, shocked, gasps and opens his eyes, looking around.]

Tony Stark: What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me.

Steve Rogers: We won.

Tony Stark: Alright, Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let’s just not come in tomorrow. Let’s just take a day. You ever tried shawarma? There’s a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don’t know what it is, but I wanna try it.

Thor: We’re not finished yet.

Tony Stark: And then shawarma after? [Loki crawls over to a stair and turns to see the Avengers surrounding him. Hawkeye has an arrow aimed at his face. Natasha is holding his scepter. Hulk growls.]

Loki: If it’s all the same to you, I’ll have that drink now.

MALE REPORTER: (V.O) Despite the dev [There is a montage of shots from television news. The dialogue speaking.] devastation of what has been confirmed as an extraterrestrial attack, the extraordinary heroics of the group known as the Avengers

MALE CITIZEN: It’s really great knowing they’re out there, you know. That someone’s watching over us.

FEMALE CITIZEN: I love you, Thor!

HUSBAND: I just don’t feel safe with those thing out there.

WIFE: It seems like there’s a lot they’re not telling us.

STAN LEE: Superheroes? In New York? Give me a break!

THE SENATOR: These so called heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to the city. This was their fight. Where are they now? [The Avengers and Selvig all walk to the center of a footbridge. Tony is carrying a briefcase, Thor has Loki in a muzzle and handcuffs, Barton, Natasha, Banner, and Steve walk from cars.]

REPORTER: (V.O) Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves, their sudden appearance and equally sudden disappearance.

WAITRESS: (V.O) What, that this is all somehow their fault? [On Fury’s screen is the WAITRESS talking on CNN.] Captain America saved my life. Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are, I would just- I would wanna say thank you. [On the four screens above are the coucil members].

COUNCILMAN 2: Where are the Avengers?

FURY: I’m not currently tracking their whereabouts. I’d say they’ve earned a leave of absence.

COUNCILWOMAN: (O.S) And the Tesseract? [Selvig take a glass cylinder out of a truck. Tony opens his case, which is on the ground. Banner holds the Cube with some tongs and puts it into the glass cylinder Selvig has. Over this footage]

FURY: (V.O) The Tesseract is where belongs...out of our reach.

COUNCILMAN: That’s not your call.

FURY: I didn’t make it. I just didn’t argue with the god that did. [Thor is smiling as he shakes hands and says goodbye to Selvig.]

COUNCILMAN: (V.O) So you let him take it... [Loki is bound and gagged in the muzzle, he is mad. As he looks upon Natasha, she whispers something into Barton’s ear that makes him smile.] and the war criminal Loki, who should be answering for his crime.

FURY: (V.O) Oh I think he will be. [Thor holds the cylinder that has the Tesseract in it. He gestures it to Loki, who grabs one end of the cylinder and Thor has the other, he nods to the others and twists the device, which lights up and the two vanish into the sky as the group looks on. In front of Tony’s new car, Steve and him shake hands.]

COUNCILWOMAN: I don’t think you understand what you’ve started... [Natasha takes a duffel bag out of the backseat of a SHIELD car. She hands it to Banner as Barton heads to the driver’s seat.] ..letting The Avengers loose on this world. They’re dangerous. [Banner and Tony get into his new car and drive off]

FURY: (V.O) They surely are, and the whole world knows it. Every world knows it!

COUNCILMAN: Was that the point in all this? A statement. [Steve is riding a motorcycle. He smiles.]

FURY: (V.O) A promise. [The council signs off and Fury exits the room.]

MARIA HILL: (V.O) Sir, how does it work now...? [Hill and Fury make their way across the bridge while talking.]...They’ve gone their separate ways, some pretty extremely far. We get into a situation like this again, what happens then?

FURY: They’ll come back! [They reach the air deck.]

MARIA HILL: Really sure about that?

FURY: I am. [Fury looks out over the helicarrier.]

MARIA HILL: Why?

FURY: Because we’ll need them to. [Hill nods, in respect. She turns and walks back over the bridge and takes a folder from a SHIELD agent. Fury stands proud on the air deck. Pepper and Stark are looking at plans for a new tower. The huge STARK on the side of the tower has been destroyed, save for the letter "A". Meanwhile, The Other kneels at the feet of another alie.n].

THE OTHER: Humans, they are not the cowering wretches we were promised. They stand. They are unruly and therefore cannot be ruled. [DISEMBODIED FIGURE in a chair stands. The Other bows, like he is in pain.]

THE OTHER: To challenge them, is to court Death. [DISEMBODIED FIGURE turns and smiles, revealing himself to be the infamous alien Thanos]

[SHAWARMA JOINT- DAY The Avengers are sitting around a table, eating, stuffing their faces. They are silent, no one makes a peep. The 221 workers are cleaning up this destroyed place. The place is silent]
