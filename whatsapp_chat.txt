[08/09/25, 3:55:55 AM] ~ Raji: My rules were food for more than 2 weeks is unacceptable, our room trash cans will not have food waste, nothing minus bags and footwear stay on the floor, and set a time for her to wipe her side and vacuum and sweep which is every Saturday mornings now
[08/09/25, 3:56:29 AM] ~ Raji: And the really hilarious part is that apparently it’s a problem I am asking her to take her food out which has been in the fridge for more than 2 weeks and move it to the common fridge

[08/09/25, 4:11:57 AM] Ayushi Kulkarni: omg she is a menace to society wth
[08/09/25, 4:12:11 AM] Ayushi Kulkarni: wait raji if you don’t mind me asking, how did you guys become roomates?
[08/09/25, 4:19:50 AM] ~ Raji: No I don’t mind…I knew her from school and didn’t know anyone else without a roommate and accepted with her…but didn’t know she was like this until May…and I couldn’t back out😭😭😭
[08/09/25, 4:20:45 AM] Ayushi Kulkarni: oh no 😭😭😭
[08/09/25, 4:21:09 AM] Ayushi Kulkarni: ugh people are so annoying, they act one way just to get a roomate but they are a whole another person after
[08/09/25, 4:23:17 AM] ~ Raji: Yea and she was like oh if anything happens you can’t fight with me…
[08/09/25, 4:23:26 AM] ~ Raji: I am literally waiting for this year to get over
[08/09/25, 4:40:31 AM] Ayushi Kulkarni: HUHHH
[08/09/25, 4:41:09 AM] Ayushi Kulkarni: i’m sorry that this is happening to you too but if things get worse maybe see if you can talk to someone about it
[08/09/25, 4:48:24 AM] ~ Raji: Yea if it gets worse I am going to my RA about it

[08/09/25, 7:42:16 AM] Shayna New No: Let me tell u a psychological way of getting it done
[08/09/25, 7:42:20 AM] Shayna New No: Bring her friends
[08/09/25, 7:42:34 AM] Shayna New No: And make them feel awkward when room so bad. She will clean automatically
[08/09/25, 7:42:50 AM] Shayna New No: Is she easy to manipulate?
[08/09/25, 8:42:02 AM] ~ Raji: Oh no I wish…I literally tell her infront of our friends that her side is a mess and she still does nothing
[08/09/25, 9:04:46 AM] Shayna New No: Oh goddd
